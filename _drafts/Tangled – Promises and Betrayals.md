# Tangled – Promises and Betrayals

[Tangled | Disney Wiki | Fandom](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Tangled)

I would say [Tangled (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/)'s recurring theme is **promises and betrayals**.

The **magic golden flower** is described as **"the sun's gift"**, which becomes personified in Rapunzel. Her position towards the theme is that **Rapunzel never breaks a promise**. As she is ascribed to magic, or the heavens (the sun representing a height so unreachable), **this value of never breaking promises is implied to be beyond mere human reach**. Yet, Rapunzel, fully human, actually keeps every single promise she makes.
