# Disney's Raya - TV Series Pitch

~~I just watched the movie. I probably should do a 5v5 Film Review first. It's really solid. I don't know, 2021-2022 was just a period of a lot of meh movies, but Raya really stood out on its own. Of course I'm biased with my own South East Asian representation.~~

~~Quite obviously even to casual moviegoers, Raya would have definitely benefited from more screentime.~~

Spine: The Weakest Tribe

→ I mean weakest in terms of contribution towards the overall story development.

Trust: Tricking vs Betraying

This one reddit post felt the best to me.

Overview

## Major rewrite changes

- The forces
- For Raya's arc specifically, Namaari should be genuine post-apocalypse
  - what if Sisu had a reason not to trust Raya? #todo

### Original Plot Structure

- **Hook**: Raya is trained by her father, Chief Benja of the Heart tribe, to protect the Dragon Gem from the other greedy tribes. They are betrayed by Naamari and other tribes. The Gem gets broken, which releases the Druun spirits that devour the land of Kumandra. As each tribe steals a Gem Piece for themselves, Raya's father is petrified in sacrifice to save Raya.
- **Inciting Incident**: Six years later, Raya manages to summon Sisu, the last dragon. Together, they must reassemble the Dragon Gem Pieces from each of the five tribes. Then, Sisu can banish the Druun and reunite the tribes.
- **Key Event**: At the Tail tribe, the duo sets out to Tail's vault for its Gem Piece.
- **First Plot Point**: Raya and Sisu take Tail's Gem Piece, but encounter and are hunted by the Fang tribe, led by Naamari. They escape with a sailor boy named Boun.
- **First Pinch Point**: At the Talon tribe, Raya is tricked by con artist baby Little Noi. Sisu is tricked by Talon chieftess Dang Hu. Raya steals Talon's Gem Piece.
- **Midpoint**: At the Spine tribe, the gang recruits Spine warrior Tong and gains his Piece. They are ambushed by Naamari and a squad of Fang soldiers. Sisu reveals her true form to help the gang escape.
- **Second Pinch Point**: Sisu takes Raya back to the Heart tribe, which had been decimated by the Druun because of Raya's naiveté. Sisu shows how her siblings entrusted her with the Gem, and reminded Raya of her father's dream of a united Kumandra. Thus, Sisu convinces Raya to offer Naamari a chance and alliance.
- **Third Plot Point**: At the Fang tribe, the gang discreetly sends a treaty to Naamari to assemble their Gem.
- **Climactic Inciting**: Raya interrupts Naamari's crossbow pointed at Sisu, which causes it to release and kills her. With the last dragon gone, all the water dries up. The Druun begin to overrun Fang.
- **Climactic Midpoint**: Raya duels with Naamari. Naamari accuses Raya for Sisu's death since she didn't trust her.
- **Climactic Moment**: Trapped, Raya gets the gang to give up their tribe's Gem Pieces to Namaari, just like Sisu's siblings did for her. They turn to stone. Instead of escaping, Naamari combines the Gem Pieces, which vanquishes the Druun, revives the petrified back to life, and brings back the dragons and water.
- **Resolution**: Everyone reunites with their tribes and family, especially Raya and her father. Every tribe gathers at Heart for a feast, united as one Kumandra.
