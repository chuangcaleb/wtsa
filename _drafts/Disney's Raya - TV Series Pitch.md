# Disney's Raya - TV Series Pitch


~~I just watched the movie. I probably should do a 5v5 Film Review first. It's really solid. I don't know, 2021-2022 was just a period of a lot of meh movies, but Raya really stood out on its own. Of course I'm biased with my own South East Asian representation.~~

~~Quite obviously even to casual moviegoers, Raya would have definitely benefited from more screentime.~~

Spine: The Weakest Tribe

→ I mean weakest in terms of contribution towards the overall story development.

Trust: Tricking vs Betraying

This one reddit post felt the best to me. [Raya and the Last Dragon undermines its own theme. Let's fix that. : fixingmovies](https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/qgcyjb/raya_and_the_last_dragon_undermines_its_own_theme/)

Overview

## Major rewrite changes

- The forces
- For Raya's arc specifically, Namaari should be genuine post-apocalypse
	- what if Sisu had a reason not to trust Raya? #todo
- 

### Original Plot Structure

- **Hook**: Raya is trained by her father, Chief Benja of the Heart tribe, to protect the Dragon Gem from the other greedy tribes. They are betrayed by Naamari and other tribes. The Gem gets broken, which releases the Druun spirits that devour the land of Kumandra. As each tribe steals a Gem Piece for themselves, Raya's father is petrified in sacrifice to save Raya.
- **Inciting Incident**: Six years later, Raya manages to summon Sisu, the last dragon. Together, they must reassemble the Dragon Gem Pieces from each of the five tribes. Then, Sisu can banish the Druun and reunite the tribes.
- **Key Event**: At the Tail tribe, the duo sets out to Tail's vault for its Gem Piece.
- **First Plot Point**: Raya and Sisu take Tail's Gem Piece, but encounter and are hunted by the Fang tribe, led by Naamari. They escape with a sailor boy named Boun.
- **First Pinch Point**: At the Talon tribe, Raya is tricked by con artist baby Little Noi. Sisu is tricked by Talon chieftess Dang Hu. Raya steals Talon's Gem Piece.
- **Midpoint**: At the Spine tribe, the gang recruits Spine warrior Tong and gains his Piece. They are ambushed by Naamari and a squad of Fang soldiers. Sisu reveals her true form to help the gang escape.
- **Second Pinch Point**: Sisu takes Raya back to the Heart tribe, which had been decimated by the Druun because of Raya's naiveté. Sisu shows how her siblings entrusted her with the Gem, and reminded Raya of her father's dream of a united Kumandra. Thus, Sisu convinces Raya to offer Naamari a chance and alliance.
- **Third Plot Point**: At the Fang tribe, the gang discreetly sends a treaty to Naamari to assemble their Gem.
- **Climactic Inciting**: Raya interrupts Naamari's crossbow pointed at Sisu, which causes it to release and kills her. With the last dragon gone, all the water dries up. The Druun begin to overrun Fang.
- **Climactic Midpoint**: Raya duels with Naamari. Naamari accuses Raya for Sisu's death since she didn't trust her.
- **Climactic Moment**: Trapped, Raya gets the gang to give up their tribe's Gem Pieces to Namaari, just like Sisu's siblings did for her. They turn to stone. Instead of escaping, Naamari combines the Gem Pieces, which vanquishes the Druun, revives the petrified back to life, and brings back the dragons and water.
- **Resolution**: Everyone reunites with their tribes and family, especially Raya and her father. Every tribe gathers at Heart for a feast, united as one Kumandra.

## Overview Disclaimer

- If I were to properly rewrite the story, I'd change names like "Benja" and "Druun". However, to prevent needless confusion, I'll leave the names as they are. Just imagine that the names feel a bit more cultural/mythical!

## Episode 1 - Kumandra

> Theme: The untrusting world of Kumandra - Past, Present, Future

### Skip the Prologue

- Let's rework the opening narration scene. Unless Raya had someone to explain Kumandra to?
- There are two "backstories" to exposition-dump.
	1. 500 years ago: Dragons defeating the Druun,
	2. 6 years ago: Kumandra divided over the Gem
- There's just so much exposition to cover. But I think that the 500 years ago story is not as personal nor action-packed as opening straight away with Young Raya.
- We could copy Avatar: The Last Airbender and start with a narration intro of the 500-years-ago events. But ATLA's intro is just so dense and juicy in [45 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOWBBMC__w0). Unless we can shave down the dragons-vs-Druun backstory down to that, I think it's better to start in the first scene with Raya and Benja immediately, just like how ATLA starts with Katara and Sokka.

%%
- `Let's skip the pre/prologue and immediately start the first episode with a hooded figure in a drought-parched wasteland` (see [[#SEA-Cultural Tail]]). `We don't need to get any other worldbuilding exposition (yet)!`
- `The figure stumbles upon some small camp of wasteland nomads.`

### Hook: Can we trust other tribes? (Parallel-Intercut Thriller)

#### Now: Establishing current-day/setting and the main character's overarching goals

![|300](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/barren-terraced-rice-field-northern-thailand-arid-climate-dry-season-69358738.jpg) 
![|300](https://i0.wp.com/project2049.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Asiaeye_southeast-asia-drought_033110.jpg) 
![|300](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/barren-rice-field-cracked-land-thailand-dry-fields-parched-harvest-season-274385599.jpg)

- Establishing shots of Tail: it's a southeastern wasteland. Not a typical American/African desert, but instead we have a hilly terrain of caked soil, hard from the heat. The sparse and small vegetation all yellow up from dehydration. Small rats and lizards scuttle for cover from the heat of noonday.
	- > Chyron: TAIL - CURRENT DAY
- We have a masked lone adult rider, on an animal mount. Very quickly, let's change Tuk-Tuk to be some panda-pangolin hybrid.
- She holds up a map. X-marks litter the landscape. The camera focuses on a drawing of the complete Dragon Gem, circled and in the center of drawn pointed arrows.
	- This woman really wants this Gem.

#### Past: Establishing young Raya

- Cut to a dripping carved-out tunnel passageway
	- > Chyron: HEART - FIFTEEN YEARS EARLIER
	- It's bright and colourful, in contrast to the pale and lifeless Tail.
- We introduce young Raya, in full stealth/combat gear
	- she holds the same dragon pendant from the previous scene, to establish she's the same character
- In a tunnel of sorts, she bypasses traps `by identifying and working around rigged false-hopes and paths `— with the help of her then-smaller mount, Tuk-Tuk.
- She enters the Chamber of the Dragon Gem, guarded by a silhouetted guardian.
	- There is a glowing blue Gem on a pedestal in the center of the room, the same one as pictured in the map in the current day.
	- The guardian calls Raya by name (establishing her name to the audience), and announces that he won't let her step one foot into the inner circle platform where the Gem is.
- They fight it out
	- Raya addresses the guardian as "Chief Benja" of the Heart tribe
- `Chief Benja would taunt Raya by saying aloud his moves ahead of time. Raya says she doesn't trust him, moving oppositely. But Chief Benja always tells the truth, which causes Raya to fail her blocks and attacks.`
- Ultimately, Benja disarms her. However, Raya had won: she had one toe on the inner circle platform.
	- Chief Benja congratulates her daughter, revealing to the audience that he is her father who is training her.
- Benja awards Raya's success by promoting her to Guardian of the Dragon Gem.
- This sequence was quite fun, especially the reveal that the masked guardian is her father, and then that Raya beats him and gets promoted.
- Raya exclaims how great it is to have two protectors of the Gem, `and since we're going to cut the opening intro explaining the warring tribes, Raya can also just announce how ready the tribe of Heart is to defend the Gem from the other tribes who want to get it for themselves.`

```screenplay
YOUNG RAYA
Anyone hoping to steal the dragon gem now has to face the fury of the TWO baddest blades in all the lands. 

BENJA
I'm glad you feel prepared, dewdrop, because the other lands... they're on their way here as we speak.

YOUNG RAYA
They are?! Right NOW?!

BENJA
Yes. And we must prepare to meet them.

Benja heroically draws his whip-sword, its segments clicking into place. Raya eyes widen and she gasps. Today's the day.
```

- We end the scene ambiguously there, that the other lands are about to lay siege just as they finished their training. And jump straight to:

#### Now: Raya's current goal

- It's approaching sundown, and the rider spots a small camp of wasteland nomads.
	- The camp is built on top of a small, pitiful water spring.
- The rider pulls down her face mask, and it's obviously adult Raya!
- Raya glances at her map. She points at her current location via a nearby landmark, and finds that the camp's location is over a circled river that is not checked off yet.
- The rider dismounts, slouching bent-over and dragging her steps, her mount the same. 
- She approaches the camp, but a figure notices her, and runs out towards her.
	- She checks her sidearm — yes, Chief Benja's whip-sword is there and ready.
- Cut.


### We can trust other tribes! Party time!

#### Past: Benja's party

- With Benja's trailing sentence, "We must prepare to meet them."
- With a loud grunt, Benja raises his whip-sword, and brings it down on…
	- A wide shot reveals Benja is cutting a giant lemongrass plant.
- "Uh, dad, shouldn't we be getting ready to face the enemy tribes?"
	- "Thank you for reminding me, I'll need someone to retrieve some jewellery from our treasuries and wrap them nicely in our finest *batik* cloths."
- Raya is perplexed??
	- "We are throwing a Kumandra feast, Raya. The first time in the line of ten chiefs, since The Great Division."
- "But dad, what about "

#### Now: Developing Tail

- The nomad, an elderly lady, introduces herself: "We are the Boh Hong family from the tribe of Tail. We do not have much, but we survive."
	- Raya spots the nomad hide her hand with many expensive rings into her pocket.
- The nomad continues, "What can we do for you, weary traveller?"
	- "My name is Namaari," Raya lies, "daughter of Rahmidah, tribe of Spine. We fled here after my village was destroyed by the Druun… I know we are not of your tribe, but we seek refuge and water just for the night."
- The nomad is suspicious. "Spine is too strong to fall. Besides, why didn't you go to the other tribes, Fang or Talon? You'd even be better off in Heart than here in Tail." (establishing the other tribes names)
	- "The… chief of Tail… gave my family a promise for refuge. A known *pinturi* is better than two unknown *bandori*?"
	- Raya stutters a bit here. The nomad picks up on it — she grips her dagger behind her back.
- The nomad spots Raya's whip-sword, exactly the one her father used. The nomad starts, "Is that…?"
	- Raya twist her hips away to hide the whip-sword. "We are very exhausted. If you do not trust me, I shall just continue on my quest."
- "Stay here for tonight. But leave my family by daybreak."
- "Thank you for your hospitality, and for displaying the spirit of Kumandra."
- Raya holds out her arm, in a customary greeting. "Kumandra in All."
	- The nomad interlocks her own arm, responding, "One in Kumandra."
	- With a wide shot, both women still clench their weapons with their other hand.
