# Raya and the Last Dragon ‚Äì TV Series Pitch

I just watched the movie. I probably should do a 5v5 Film Review first. It's really solid. I don't know, 2021-2022 was just a period of a lot of meh movies, but Raya really stood out on its own. Of course I'm biased with my own South East Asian representation. But the story is solid.

Quite obviously even to casual moviegoers, Raya would have definitely benefited from more screentime.

Spine: The Weakest Tribe

‚Üí I mean weakest in terms of contribution towards the overall story development.

Trust: Tricking vs Betraying

This one reddit post felt the best to me. [Raya and the Last Dragon undermines its own theme. Let's fix that. : fixingmovies](https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/qgcyjb/raya_and_the_last_dragon_undermines_its_own_theme/)

## Non-story changes

### Inconsistent Anatopism/Anachronism with SEA Culture

Throughout the movie, 

1. They do mention real-life local fruits like *jackfruit*, and the world is obviously based off SEA more than any other region.
2. We've got psuedo-words like *binturi* and *Kumandra*, and lots of the cultures, while it doesn't exist in real life, it's enough to fool most people to be SEA-like.
3. Then we've got climates (deserts and snow) and dialogue ("Flaming catupults!") and animals that simply just aren't from SEA at all.

It feels like they're deliberately trying to create a new and different culture only *inspired* by SEA. **But the worldbuilding is too different to be considered Southeast Asian, whilst being too Southeast Asian to be considered different.** There's just too much stuff from point 3 that clashes discordantly. The non-SEA fictional elements aren't fleshy/fleshed out enough to stand together with the real-life SEA elements, especially in a short movie, and I think it would've been so great to just lean into SEA culture‚Äîor at least to squirm away from whatever clashes with it.

> But Raya's worldbuilding is too different to be considered Southeast Asian, whilst being too Southeast Asian to be considered different.

#### SEA Names, Word Choices, Personality

Names are where it really breaks suspension of disbelief for me.

Naamari sounds too African when Fang is Angkor Wat inspired. While "Raya" is peak Indo-Malaysian‚Äîher father's name, Benja, is very European. Some Kumandran would've had to have coined the double U's in "Druun", but there's just no such phonetic anywhere remotely in Asia. **Same symptom of the *it's-SEA-culture-but-it's-not-at-all* thing.** Let's have cultural diversity, sure, but there's no cultural *consistency*.

I've just read on [Water Tribe | Avatar Wiki | Fandom](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Water_Tribe) that *the names of the Southern and Northern Tribes' citizens often include one or two "K"s and have an "AH" sound (Katara, Hakoda, Sokka, Pakku, Kya, Kanna, Arnook, Korra, Tarrlok, Yakone, Noatak, Eska, Varrick etc.),*.  Notice how none of the names sound Oriental or Western. Even if (and especially when) not coupled with the original culture, this is just one example how some level of *consistency* and pattern made ATLA's inspired fictional cultures feel so realistic to their world. This is the gold standard here. Study more at [Mantilla & Converse ‚Äî Patterns in Given Names in the World of Avatar](https://catie-does-things.tumblr.com/post/626470358390833152/patterns-in-given-names-in-the-world-of-avatar).

```screenplay
TONG
And you will be reunited with your family, Noi.

RAYA
Um, what did you just call her?

TONG
Noi. It‚Äôs her name. It‚Äôs written on her collar. Have none of you ever checked?

Everyone is guilty.

TONG (CONT'D)
And they think of me as the ruffian.
```

Con-Baby Noi is named as "Little Noi" in the credits, which I assume is meant to be "Xiao(Â∞è/Little) Noi", which adds so much intimacy. but Tong just calls her by her first name like a Western person (in the East, it's a capital crime). In a similar vein, the script has Tong say "ruffian". They might as well say "mafia" or "gangster". And "Jerky" in "Jackfruit Jerky" is too Western. Just say "dried jackfruit". Even in Mulan or Aladdin, Mushu and Genie gets the pass only because they're magical beings, and it's only ever one character i.e. the exception.

A lot more choice words could've been transliterated, like *laksamana* (admiral), or some character facepalming and going "*Aduhai! Budak ini.*" Cultural idioms/proverbs like *nasi sudah menjadi bubur* ‚Äì even when said aloud in directly-translated English, "[the] rice already turned into porridge" is way better and more appropriate than "no use crying over spilt milk".

The biggest culprit of language is Sisu. Sisu's personality is just too modern Western (temporally and culturally) for a show set in the traditional East. She uses terms like "group projects", "nightlights", "Captain Pop and Lock"‚Ä¶ especially for a creature of the culture, Sisu of all characters must be kept local.

But what about Mushu from Mulan, or the Genie from Aladdin? They're also comedic relief characters whose premise are based on the culture, but their personality is way different." Well, firstly, Mushu and Genie are HILARIOUS and charismatic. And I also think the writers were trying to replicate these iconic characters, but Sisu's comedic dialogue choices just fall flat ("I'm not like‚Ä¶ the bEsT dragon.") and charisma is really important for holding suspension of disbelief. It also does help that you had characters like the Matchmaker/the Emperor or the Sultan/Jafar (basically the rest of the cast) who are VERY much culturalized, and they set the cultural norm of the film's setting, keeping the magical anachronistic characters as the one exception.

And finally, in the same vein, Raya carries her worldbuilding much more than Mulan or Aladdin. The mystical elements in Mulan and Aladdin are quite simple and straightforward and already established since they don't stray too far from the real world‚Äîespecially when compared to the depth of world history and even sub-cultures found in Raya. This is compounded with the inconsistent *SEA-but-not-really* worldbuilding strategy. China and Agrabah are quite already-established settings. But dragons are supposed to be the core of this new world, and Sisu is the only dragon we really see (and hear!) but we're not quite sure whether the dragons are Southeast Asian, and by extension, whether the world is Southeast Asian. Imagine‚ÄîAang from Avatar the Last Airbender has an American personality like Sisu. Since Aang is the only Air Nation we get, we'd assume the entire Air Nation (and by extension, 1/4 of the Avatar world) is American. How much more so the dragons, which represent all of Kumandra?

#### Other SEA culture

Let's talk about the creatures too‚ÄîTuk-Tuk is a cross of the [Armadillidiidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillidiidae) (native to Europe) and [Armadillo - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillo) (South America). Fang's cat-tigers (which are named "Serlot". Not very cultural) are based on [Caracals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracal) (Central Asia at best) ‚Äî at least let them have Malayan Tiger's stripes! Tail's "Toot n' Boom" beetle could be the [Brown marmorated stink bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_marmorated_stink_bug#cite_note-2) (Northern Asia), and get this‚Äîthey were [originally designed as farting gophers](https://collider.com/raya-and-the-last-dragon-farting-beetles-explained/) [North America]. And I quote, *"No one had one note and all of a sudden, here you have these characters whose main contribution to the movie is that they fart.*" At least the "Ongi" monkeys (half-catfish, apparently) from Talon are distinctly Southeast Asian. They got Talon's culture correct, and it does carry through.

Even just funny Asian things like our easily swayed inclinations to "free gifts", or certain characters having random silly superstitions about not eating certain types of meat or *X* will happen.

Early on, Young Raya talks about fighting with crossbows and flaming catapults. The former, perhaps, but I don't think the latter was ever used in Southeast Asian warfare. That took me way out.

Tiny details that should be too small to matter, like hairstyles and even architecture‚Ä¶ just doesn't quite do it.

It just feels too‚Ä¶ *inconsistent*. And it feels globalized, when a story like this functions better if localized. Which is a shame, because other productions like [[Over The Moon ‚Äì Film Review|Over the Moon]] prove that it is possible to satisfyingly blend traditional cultures with otherworldly elements, even in an English language medium.

#### SEA Tribes

So let's get the subcultures down:

- Heart is *Indo-Malaysia* because "Raya"
- Fang is *Cambodia* because Angkor Wat
- (Talon's perfect for what it is, nothing much to say here)
- and then *Viking/Japan* and *Africa*. The two non-tropical tribes got the least screen time.

The voices could've had stronger accents too. There was a layer of dissonance that I couldn't match the Southeast Asian I'm supposed to be hearing, and the accents I was actually hearing.

##### SEA-Cultural Tail

For inspiration for Tail, %%I've found *[Bao Trang](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bao-trang-the-white-sand-dunes)*, or the White Sand Dunes, in Vietnam. They don't have camels, but they have sheep and cattle. But doesn't have to be super desert-y.%% Southeast Asia frequently goes through spells of drought. Tail could just have perpetual drought, and could look like the pictures here: [Worst Drought in Decades Disrupts Life in Southeast Asia's Mekong Region](https://www.nbcnews.com/slideshow/worst-drought-decades-disrupts-life-southeast-asia-s-mekong-region-n562166).

>![|400](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2016_17/1512106/ss-160425-southeast-asia-drought-01.jpg)

> ‚Äî RUNGROJ YONGRIT / EPA

Now that's a distinctly *Southeast Asian* wasteland. There may not be desert-sand, but the cracks in the ground shows parched forest-soil. The dead tree stumps. Even just the white sky feels more \*right\* than the saturated blue in the movie. Movie!Tail just looked too African to me.

![|400](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nparks.gov.sg%2F-%2Fmedia%2Fnparks-real-content%2Fgardens-parks-and-nature%2Fparks-and-nature-reserve%2Fsungei-buloh%2Fmb.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=b760ef44bb9d9b2a273d50dfbcd9764d50364f2733cf2b7fdd768b8d75418cf5&ipo=images)
> [Mangrove rehabilitation in South East Asia - the state of practice - - - What's On - Activities - National Parks Board (NParks)](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/activities/events-and-workshops/2018/2/3-feb-talk-at-sbwr)

And what if, Tail used to be a healthy mangrove swamp with flowing rivers ‚Äî but then, because all the rivers dried up, it left behind the drought wasteland in the previous picture?

An (ex-)mangrove swamp seems very in line with Tail in the final movie too, I can imagine a booby-trapped swamp stronghold, instead of a desert one!

##### SEA-Cultural Spine

With the snow in Spine, I was certain that the show wasn't trying to be Southeast Asian. Like with their predominantly Northeast Asian cast, the snowy bamboo forest was way more reminiscent of China/Korea/Japan. And they could've totally expanded the worldbuilding to encompass the whole of East Asia ‚Äî but no, the Spine tribespeople have dark skin. In a cold, dark, snowy climate, where they should be lighter-skinned.

Even the Water Tribe in Avatar: The Last Airbender needed to move away from its Asian cultures of the other three tribes to use Inuit/Native American cultures, because Asia simply does not have that kind specific kind of biome to realistically tie in Asian culture with freezing climates, especially since the Water Tribes are literally the North and South Pole, the coldest you can go. Imagine trying to tie in the hot and dry African or Middle Eastern culture, clothing and lifestyle into that setting. It's just not realistic.

Besides that, if it's cold, then the tribespeople of Spine could be fleshier to have better cold resistance. Raya says their warriors are large. But the chief of Spine isn't particularly big. Make him bigger.

To stick with SEA, you could change Spine to look more like Shang Chi's bamboo forest, but with a cooler bluish tint:

![|400](https://www.cgw.com/images/RINGS_Marketing_Stills.27609636.png)

Let them be lighter-skinned. There could still be patches of snow, but not everywhere.

And it would add to have people from Spine say, "We used to have chili from Tail to make Kumandra Stew, we miss the spiciness that helped to warm us in the cold. Not anymore since the Druun." There's so much to build on!

So Google has just informed me that nobody uses giant axes to cut bamboo (they use saws/shears, because it's *that* sturdy) so it doesn't make too much sense for Spine to main axes. Heavy swings get stuck on bamboo. We need something lighter, more agile, yet ferocious. What about bamboo spears?

### Cooler Gem Weapons

When one of the main gang simply holds out a gem piece to ward off a Druun: it's kind of a lame action. It's not very visual, nor shows off fantastical physical feats, or at least some effort on the character's part to effectively wield the gem stones.

It would be WAY cooler if every tribe's gem piece should be incorporated uniquely into tribe-centric artifacts. Think of it exactly like the containers for *Marvel*'s *Avenger*'s Infinity Stones (the *Tesserect* for the Space Stone, the *Aether* for the Reality Stone), or like *Pirate of the Caribbean*'s *At World's End*'s "Pieces of Eight"?

- Chief Benja's gem-embedded whip-sword *keris* for Heart
- Naamari's dragon pendant for Fang, perhaps incorporated into the spear that she uses in their final duel at Spine
- I could only find something like the claw/hook-shaped *[aruval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aruval)* for Talon
- A gem-tipped bamboo spear for Spine
- Tail's the most underdeveloped, so they could have anything, really. Perhaps something crude, like a robber's *[parang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parang_%28knife%29)* (what I think Naamari uses in the final duel)?

Then, as each member of the gang use a Gem Piece to fight off the Druun, they can actually incorporate expert combat skills and unique fighting styles.

### Original Plot Structure

- **Hook**: Raya is trained by her father, Chief Benja of the Heart tribe, to protect the Dragon Gem from the other greedy tribes. They are betrayed by Naamari and other tribes. The Gem gets broken, which releases the Druun spirits that devour the land of Kumandra. As each tribe steals a Gem Piece for themselves, Raya's father is petrified in sacrifice to save Raya.
- **Inciting Incident**: Six years later, Raya manages to summon Sisu, the last dragon. Together, they must reassemble the Dragon Gem Pieces from each of the five tribes. Then, Sisu can banish the Druun and reunite the tribes.
- **Key Event**: At the Tail tribe, the duo sets out to Tail's vault for its Gem Piece.
- **First Plot Point**: Raya and Sisu take Tail's Gem Piece, but encounter and are hunted by the Fang tribe, led by Naamari. They escape with a sailor boy named Boun.
- **First Pinch Point**: At the Talon tribe, Raya is tricked by con artist baby Little Noi. Sisu is tricked by Talon chieftess Dang Hu. Raya steals Talon's Gem Piece.
- **Midpoint**: At the Spine tribe, the gang recruits Spine warrior Tong and gains his Piece. They are ambushed by Naamari and a squad of Fang soldiers. Sisu reveals her true form to help the gang escape.
- **Second Pinch Point**: Sisu takes Raya back to the Heart tribe, which had been decimated by the Druun because of Raya's naivet√©. Sisu shows how her siblings entrusted her with the Gem, and reminded Raya of her father's dream of a united Kumandra. Thus, Sisu convinces Raya to offer Naamari a chance and alliance.
- **Third Plot Point**: At the Fang tribe, the gang discreetly sends a treaty to Naamari to assemble their Gem.
- **Climactic Inciting**: Raya interrupts Naamari's crossbow pointed at Sisu, which causes it to release and kills her. With the last dragon gone, all the water dries up. The Druun begin to overrun Fang.
- **Climactic Midpoint**: Raya duels with Naamari. Naamari accuses Raya for Sisu's death since she didn't trust her.
- **Climactic Moment**: Trapped, Raya gets the gang to give up their tribe's Gem Pieces to Namaari, just like Sisu's siblings did for her. They turn to stone. Instead of escaping, Naamari combines the Gem Pieces, which vanquishes the Druun, revives the petrified back to life, and brings back the dragons and water.
- **Resolution**: Everyone reunites with their tribes and family, especially Raya and her father. Every tribe gathers at Heart for a feast, united as one Kumandra.

### Rewritten Plot Structure

## Episode 1 - Kumandra

Theme: The world of Kumandra - Past, Present, Future

### Prologue

- Let's rework the opening narration scene. Unless Raya had someone to explain Kumandra to?
- There are two "backstories" to exposition-dump.
	1. 500 years ago: Dragons defeating the Druun,
	2. 6 years ago: Kumandra divided over the Gem
- There's just so much exposition to cover. But I think that the 500 years ago story is not as personal nor action-packed as opening straight away with Young Raya.
- We could copy Avatar: The Last Airbender and start with a narration intro of the 500-years-ago events. But ATLA's intro is just so dense and juicy in [45 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOWBBMC__w0). Unless we can shave down the dragons-vs-Druun backstory down to that, I think it's better to start in the first scene with Raya and Benja immediately, just like how ATLA starts with Katara and Sokka.

%%
- `Let's skip the pre/prologue and immediately start the first episode with a hooded figure in a drought-parched wasteland` (see [[#SEA-Cultural Tail]]). `We don't need to get any other worldbuilding exposition (yet)!`
- `The figure stumbles upon some small camp of wasteland nomads.`
%%

### Young Raya

#### Rite of Passage

- We introduce young Raya, in full stealth/combat gear
- In a tunnel of sorts, she bypasses traps `by identifying and working around rigged false-hopes and paths `‚Äî with the help of her pet armadillo, Tuk-Tuk.
- She enters the Chamber of the Dragon Gem, guarded by Chief Benja, which is revealed to be her own father.
- `Chief Benja would taunt Raya by telling his moves ahead of time. Raya doesn't trust him, moving oppositely. This causes Raya to fail blocks and attacks.`
- Ultimately, Benja disarms her. However, Raya had achieved one toe on the inner circle platform.
- Benja recognizes Raya's success by promoting her to Guardian of the Dragon Gem.
- This sequence was quite fun, especially the reveal that the masked guardian is her father, and then that Raya beats him and gets promoted.

#### Dad's Wisdom `(split, Pt. 1)`

- Raya exclaims how great it is to have two protectors of the Gem, `and since we're not going to have the opening intro to explain the warring tribes, Raya can also just announce how ready they are to defend the Gem from the other tribes who want to get it for themselves.`

```screenplay
YOUNG RAYA
Anyone hoping to steal the dragon gem now has to face the fury of the TWO baddest blades in all the lands. 

BENJA
I'm glad you feel prepared, dewdrop, because the other lands... they're on their way here as we speak.

YOUNG RAYA
They are?! Right now?!

BENJA
Yes. And we must prepare to meet them.
```

- `And we leave it ambiguous there. And jump straight to:`

### Betrayal at Tail

- Chyron: TAIL - SIX YEARS LATER
- We get the wasteland shots, but instead of at the very start of the movie, it's here.
- `Cutting it straight here, we make it seem like the other lands simply attacked Heart and ravaged the land. Of course, that's not what happened, and we slowly release the backstory to the audience`
- We have a lone adult rider, on an animal mount. `Very quickly, let's change Tuk-Tuk to be an elephant-dog hybrid.`
- `It's approaching sundown, and the rider spots a camp of wasteland nomads.`
