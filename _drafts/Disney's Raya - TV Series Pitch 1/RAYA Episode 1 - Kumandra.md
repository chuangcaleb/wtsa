# RAYA Episode 1 - Kumandra

## Episode 1 - Kumandra

> Theme: The untrusting world of Kumandra - Past, Present, Future

### Skip the Prologue

- Let's rework the opening narration scene. Unless Raya had someone to explain Kumandra to?
- There are two "backstories" to exposition-dump.
	1. 500 years ago: Dragons defeating the Druun,
	2. 6 years ago: Kumandra divided over the Gem
- There's just so much exposition to cover. But I think that the 500 years ago story is not as personal nor action-packed as opening straight away with Young Raya.
- We could copy Avatar: The Last Airbender and start with a narration intro of the 500-years-ago events. But ATLA's intro is just so dense and juicy in 45 seconds. Unless we can shave down the dragons-vs-Druun backstory down to that, I think it's better to start in the first scene with Raya and Benja immediately, just like how ATLA starts with Katara and Sokka.

### Hook: Can we trust other tribes? (Parallel-Intercut Thriller)

#### Now: Establishing current-day/setting and the main character's overarching goals

- Establishing shots of Tail: it's a southeastern wasteland. Not a typical American/African desert, but instead we have a hilly terrain of caked soil, hard from the heat. The sparse and small vegetation all yellow up from dehydration. Small rats and lizards scuttle for cover from the heat of noonday.
	- > Chyron: TAIL - CURRENT DAY
- We have a masked lone adult rider, on an animal mount. Very quickly, let's change Tuk-Tuk to be some panda-pangolin hybrid.
- She holds up a map. X-marks litter the landscape. The camera focuses on a drawing of the complete Dragon Gem, circled and in the center of drawn pointed arrows.
	- This woman really wants this Gem.

#### Past: Establishing young Raya

- Cut to a dripping carved-out tunnel passageway
	- > Chyron: HEART - FIFTEEN YEARS EARLIER
	- It's bright and colourful, in contrast to the pale and lifeless Tail.
- We introduce young Raya, in full stealth/combat gear. She also has a drawing of the mythical Dragon Gem.
- In a tunnel of sorts, she bypasses traps by identifying and working around rigged false-hopes and paths — with the help of her then-smaller mount, Tuk-Tuk.
- She enters the Chamber of the Dragon Gem, guarded by a silhouetted guardian.
	- There is a glowing blue Gem on a pedestal in the center of the room, the same one as pictured in the map in the current day.
	- The guardian calls Raya by name (establishing her name to the audience), and announces that he won't let her step one foot into the inner circle platform where the Gem is.
	- The guardian never unsheathes his sword — we're saving epic reveal for later.
- They fight it out
	- Raya addresses the guardian as "Chief Benja" of the Heart tribe 
- Chief Benja would taunt Raya by saying aloud his moves ahead of time. Raya says she doesn't trust him, moving oppositely. But Chief Benja always tells the truth, which causes Raya to fail her blocks and attacks.
- Ultimately, Benja disarms her. However, Raya had won: she had one toe on the inner circle platform.
	- Chief Benja congratulates her daughter, revealing to the audience that he is her father who is training her.
- Benja awards Raya's success by promoting her to Guardian of the Dragon Gem, as her ancestors before her.
- This sequence was quite fun, especially the reveal that the masked guardian is her father, and then that Raya beats him and gets promoted.
- Raya exclaims how great it is to have two protectors of the Gem, `and since we're going to cut the opening intro explaining the warring tribes, Raya can also just announce how ready the tribe of Heart is to defend the Gem from the other tribes who want to get it for themselves.`

```screenplay
YOUNG RAYA
Anyone hoping to steal the dragon gem now has to face the fury of the TWO baddest blades in all the lands. 

BENJA
I'm glad you feel prepared, dewdrop, because the other lands... they're on their way here as we speak.

YOUNG RAYA
They are?! Right NOW?!

BENJA
Yes. And we must prepare to meet them.
```

- We end the scene ambiguously there, that the other lands are about to lay siege just as they finished their training. And jump straight to:

#### Now: Raya's current goal, ready to fight

- It's approaching sundown.
- The rider sees a purple energy just behind a nearby hill. She quickly veers in the opposite direction.
- The rider then spots a small camp of wasteland nomads.
	- The camp is built on top of a small, pitiful water spring.
- The rider pulls down her face mask, and it's obviously adult Raya!
- Raya glances at her map. She points at her current location via a nearby landmark, and finds that the camp's location is over a circled river that is not checked off yet.
- The rider dismounts, slouching bent-over and dragging her steps, her mount the same.
- She approaches the camp, but a figure notices her, and runs out towards her.
	- She checks her sidearm — yes, Chief Benja's whip-sword is there and ready.

### Kumandra party

#### Past: Benja's party

- With Benja's trailing sentence, "We must prepare to meet them. Are you ready to face the other lands?"
- Raya introduces the lands.
	- "We're from the tribe of Heart. Our rainforest rains all the time, which makes us the best for defending the Dragon Gem against the Druun."
	- "Second, Tail. A shifting dryland."
	- "Third, Talon. A floating market famous for fast deals and fighters with even faster hands."
	- "Fourth, Spine. A frigid, bamboo mountain guarded by exceptionally fierce warriors and impenetrable fortress."
	- "Fang, our most cunning enemy. An advanced city of scholars or builders, which makes their assassins frighteningly intelligent and sneaky.
- Raya, "And we're going to use your secret weapon to defeat them, once-and-for-all, right?"
	- "That's right, dewdrop." Benja turns to a table as he constructs a stew: "Chilis from Tail, shrimp paste from Talon, bamboo shoots from Spine, lemongrass from Fang, and palm sugar from Heart… my secret weapon is a Kumandra feast."
- Raya is perplexed?? "Are we poisoning them?"
	- "No tribe can survive alone anymore. This is first step to unite the five lands in the line of ten chiefs, after The Great Division. We need Kumandra in All. One in Kumandra."
- "But dad, what about all my training to become Guardian of the Dragon Gem? Who are we guarding against? Not the Druun, since it's always raining here."
	- "While we want to do the right thing, we can't be sure that the other tribes might try something selfish. They think the Gem magically grants us prosperity."
- "That's ridiculous. It doesn't do that… does it?"
	- "They assume it does, just like we assume things about them. (offers a bowl of soup) Raya, there’s a reason why each land is named after a part of the dragon. We were once unified harmoniously as one. Kumandra."
- "That's ancient history, ba."
	- "But it doesn’t have to be. Listen, if we don’t stop and learn to trust one another again, it’s only a matter of time before we tear each other apart before the actual Druun monsters do. This isn’t the world I want you to live in."
- Raya nods.
	- "I believe that we can be Kumandra again. Even if I have my second baddest blade in the land to offer a bit of wise precaution… someone has to take the first step. Trust me."

#### Now: Developing Tail

- The nomad arrives: she's an elderly lady, introduces herself: "We are the Boh Hong family of Tail. We do not have much, but we survive."
	- Raya spots the nomad hide her hand clad with many expensive rings into her pocket.
- The nomad continues, "What can we do for you, weary traveller?"
	- "My name is Namaari," Raya lies, "daughter of Rahmidah, tribe of Spine. We fled here after my village was destroyed by the Druun… I know we are not of your tribe, but we seek refuge and water just for the night."
- The nomad is suspicious. "Spine is too strong to fall. Besides, why didn't you go to the other tribes, Fang or Talon? You'd be better off even in Heart than here in the dried-up forsaken land of Tail." (establishing the other tribes names)
	- "The… chief of Tail… gave my family a promise for refuge. A known *pinturi* is better than two unknown *bandori*?"
	- Raya stutters a bit here. The nomad picks up on it — she grips her dagger behind her back.
- The nomad spots Raya's whip-sword, exactly the one her father used. The nomad starts, "Is that…?"
	- Raya twist her hips away to hide the whip-sword. "We are very exhausted. If you do not trust me, I shall just continue on my quest."
- "Stay here for tonight. But leave my family by daybreak."
- "Thank you for your hospitality, and for displaying the spirit of Kumandra."
- Raya holds out her arm, in a customary greeting. "Kumandra in All."
	- The nomad interlocks her own arm, responding, "One in Kumandra."
	- With a wide shot, both women still clench their weapons with their other hand.

#### Past: Cultural exchange

- Benja and Raya stand on the end of the main bridge leading into Heart. Four distinct factions stand arranged before them. Benja welcomes them.
	- Tail Chief: Nice speech, Chief Benja, but why’d you really bring us here? Are you gonna rob us?
	- Dang Hai (Talon Chief): "Why would he need to rob us? The land of Heart already has everything. *And what is there to rob? Even our rivers are drying up!*"(remember this)
	- Spine Chief: It’s easy to pontificate on "Kumandra" when you hold the mightiest weapon in all the lands.
	- Everyone argues.
- Raya steps forward towards the only other kid.
	- The kid steps forward from behind a woman. "I'm Namaari. Daughter of the chieftess of Fang."
	- They fangirl together and connect over Naamari's dragon pendant.
	- "Do you want to come eat my dad's Kumandra stew?"
	- They go in together
	- The adults see this, lower their defenses, and the chiefs decide to cross over too.
- Later in the palace courtroom: it's crowded but no one is mixing around.
- Young Raya and Namaari chatter about their shared princess-ship.
	- we see a bit of Naamari's Fang intelligence and sharpness
	- Naamari admits this is her first time having such a stew with so many different ingredients. Raya says she has this every day.
		- Namaari explains that Heart trades with other tribes, but the other tribes don't really mix around
		- It's not just stew, it's the technology, the architecture, the knowledge. Just look at Tail, they're still so backwards.
		- Raya exclaims! That's why Heart seems so prosperous compared to the other tribes: it's not that the Gem gives some magic favour to Heart, but it's that Heart trusts the other tribes.
- Namaari then brings up they're both Sisu fans
	- Naamari: You know, Fang legend says she’s still out there. I'm not supposed to show you this, but…
	- Naamari pulls out a Scroll that she's not supposed to show
	- It's the same scroll that adult Raya is using as her map!
- Namaari is the one to retell the legend, as it comes to life stylistically in Southeast Asian-inspired puppetry.
	- Kumandra used to be lush when humans lived harmoniously alongside dragons - magical creatures who brought us water and rain and peace.
	- Then, the Druun monsters attacked: multiplying as they consumed life and turned everyone they touched into stone.
	- The dragons fought for us but lost.
	- Finally, 500 years ago, the mighty Sisudatu, the last dragon, concentrated all her magic into a gem and defeated the Druun.
		- Everyone that was turned to stone came back… except the dragons.
		- All that was left of Sisu was her gem.
	- Instead of uniting humanity, people fought to possess the last of dragon magic.
	- Borders were drawn. Kumandra divided. We all became enemies.
	- The Gem was secured by Heart for the past 350 years, and they prospered.
- Namaari expresses, "Though the Druun are no more, yet all Kumandra isn't sharing the Gem like it was way before. It's paradise for Heart, but not for us other tribes. Not that the Gem is magical, but sharing the Gem together is the first step in being united in recognition of what Sisu has done, equally for every person in every tribe. That's what Sisu would have wanted."
- Raya points out on the scroll, that Sisu sleeps dormant at a river's end.
	- Naamari says, if they could ever track down every river, they could bring back Sisu, and reunite Kumandra.
	- Raya looks at her dad. Yes.
- Namaari gives Raya her dragon pendant necklace.
	- It's a part of Naamari's mother's sceptre.
- Raya says, "Together we'll track down Sisu one day, but I know what we can do today. Follow me."

#### Now: Raya is finding Sisu

- Adult Raya is in her tent, asleep.
- The old woman nomad sets down a bowl of soup and exits.
- Raya peeks open an eye. She's been fake-sleeping.
- Raya sneaks out of her tent, over to the circled landmark on her map.
- There's the small spring of water.
- She doesn't waste any time. She does a whole ritual.
	- "Sisudatu… I don’t know if you’re listening. I’m searching every river to find you. Look, there’s not a lot of us left and we really… we really need your help. If I can be honest, I really need your help. I made a mistake. I trusted someone I shouldn’t have. And now the world’s broken."
- Raya sits. And waits. And waits. Nothing happens.
- A voice behind her: "What are you doing here?"

### Betrayal causes Druun

#### Past: Raya vs. Naamari

- Young Raya and Naamari enter the Chamber of the Dragon Gem.
- "Thank you for sharing the Gem with me."
	- "It's what Sisu would have wanted."
- Suddenly, Naamari strikes out at Raya.
	- Raya dodges, but a branch scratches her bare calf.
	- Naamari smirks, "Peppermint brambles. Makes your muscles sleepy."
- Raya limps. "What are you doing?"
	- "I'm doing what's right for Fang."
- They take out their weapons and fight viciously.
- Raya does get the upper hand, even with her cripple, and knocks Naamari backwards.
- Naamari just smirks and shoots a whistling firework through the ceiling opening.
- At the palace, Benja is diplomat-ing with Virana.
	- "Chief Virana! I hope our daughters' newfound friendship will foster a special bond between Heart and Fang."
- Through a window, the firework explodes and illuminates the night sky.
- Benja turns back, and Fang is gone. The other tribes start to catch on.

#### Now: Confrontation

- The nomad woman appears there behind Raya. 
- "You're not from Spine, your name is not Namaari, who are you and why have you lied to me?"

#### Past: Druun unleashed

- Young Raya and Namaari continue fighting, but Fang soldiers enter the room.
	- Raya straightens her back, ready to fight to the death with her newfound anger.
- SWOOSH! Benja repels into the room, dispatches a dozen different adversaries. His sword turns into a cool grappling whip which he uses to drive everyone back. 
	- This is the same whip-sword that adult Raya has.
	- "You will not set foot on the Dragon Gem’s inner circle."
- The soldiers of the other tribes file into the room, in awe of the Gem.
	- "Fang's making a play for the Gem!"
	- "We should take it for Spine, now!"
	- Everyone readies their weapons.
	- Benja readies too, but sees young Raya in the reflection of his sword…
- Benja announces, "We have a choice. We can tear each other apart, or we can come together and build a better world. It’s not too late. I still believe we can be Kumandra again…"
- Benja unsheathes his sword.
	- Tension fills the air. Eyes dart around, who's making the first move?
- An arrow strikes Benja in the leg. He crumples.
	- "Ba!" Raya cries.
	- Everyone rushes in.
- Hands grab at the Gem, until…
	- The Gem crashes onto the ground, breaking into five pieces.
	- BOOM! The ground shakes, the water in the chamber recedes, the floor opens up.
	- From the broken Earth, a purple evil Druun monster emerges.
	- Benja: "Druun…"
- A soldier rushes in towards the Druun, slashing at it:
	- the blade makes but a small wound in the semi-permeable creature
- The Druun engulfs the soldier
	- turning him into stone
	- and duplicating
- It takes 3-4 more tough warriors to fell the original Druun,
	- but by then, they all turned to stone
- A Druun rushes towards Benja and Raya
	- Benja rushes towards a Gem piece and holds it up
	- it repels the Druun
- A mad scramble ensues as each tribe is snatched up by each tribe
- A Druun pursues, but is recoiled by dripping water
	- Benja: "Everyone to the river!"
- In the cave, the waterfalls start to dry up…

#### Now: Revelation

- "I am Raya, the last of my tribe of Heart. But I know you poisoned the stew that you gave me. Is it because you want my gem shard?"
- The nomad's face betrays her: that's exactly it.

#### Past: Sacrifice

- Heart is plunged into chaos
- People flee out of the city via the main bridge
- Benja is very injured
	- The road ahead is too far
	- The bridge shakes and a Druun approaches
- Benja hands his Gem shard to Raya. "Raya, don’t give up on them. I love you, my dewdrop."
- Benja pushes Raya off the bridge into the water
	- A Druun passes through Benja, turning him to stone
	- A current carries young Raya safely away…

#### Now: Paying the price

- A crack suddenly widens in the ground… multiple Druuns appear out!
- Raya swings her whip-sword, the blade now encrusted with the Gem shard. It effortlessly tears through the Druun, compared to the ineffective simple weapons before.
- The elderly nomad swings at the Druun with her dagger
	- but the Druun simply engulfs her, petrifying her.
- Raya chase after the Druun, but it's too late, there were too many,
	- A glow shone whenever they petrified someone. Several Druun leave the campsite.
	- They see that Raya has a Gem piece, and retreat.
- Raya gets up and stands at a distance, tiredly surveying the campsite. Everyone there is gone.
- She looks down at her map. One circle is left.
- She summons Tuk-tuk, and continues on her travels.

### Epilogue

- A woman on a Serlot (some large tiger-wolf hybrid) steps out onto an edge of a cliff.
	- she spots a hairclip in the sand. It's Raya's.
	- Some more armour-clad people on Serlots step out behind her.
	- "What are your orders, Princess Namaari?"
