## Overview Disclaimer

- If I were to properly rewrite the story, I'd change names like "Benja" and "Druun". However, to prevent needless confusion, I'll leave the names as they are. Just imagine that the names feel a bit more cultural/mythical!

# RAYA Episode 1 - Kumandra

## Episode 1 - Kumandra

> Theme: The untrusting world of Kumandra - Past, Present, Future

### Skip the Prologue

- Let's rework the opening narration scene. Unless Raya had someone to explain Kumandra to?
- There are two "backstories" to exposition-dump.
 1. 500 years ago: Dragons defeating the Druun,
 2. "6" years ago: Kumandra divided over the Gem
  - btw, retconning this to be 15 years instead of 6 years for the effects of the division to be more ingrained into the new culture
- There's just so much exposition to cover. But I think that the 500 years ago story is not as personal nor action-packed as opening straight away *in media res*.

### Hook: Can we trust other tribes?

#### Present: Establishing current-day/setting and the main character's overarching goals

> **TAIL LANDSCAPE - DAY (PRESENT)**

- Establishing shots of Tail: it's a *southeastern* wasteland. Not a typical American/African desert, but instead we have limestone cliffs, canyons and caves. The terrain is hilly, and the soil is caked, hard from the heat. The sparse and small vegetation all yellow up from dehydration. Small rats and lizards scuttle for cover from the heat of noonday.
  - > Chyron: TAIL - CURRENT DAY
- We have a masked lone adult rider, on an animal mount. Very quickly, let's change Tuk-Tuk to be some panda-pangolin hybrid. A *Pandolin*.
- She holds up a map. X-marks litter the landscape. The camera focuses on a drawing of the complete Dragon Gem, circled and in the center of drawn pointed arrows.
  - This woman really wants this Gem.

#### Past: Establishing young Raya

> **DRIPPING CARVED-OUT TUNNEL PASSAGEWAY, HEART - NIGHT (PAST)**

- Chyron: HEART - FIFTEEN YEARS EARLIER
- It's bright and colourful, in contrast to the pale and lifeless Tail.
- We introduce young Raya, in full stealth/combat gear. She also has a drawing of the mythical Dragon Gem.
- In a tunnel of sorts, she bypasses traps by identifying and working around rigged false-hopes and paths — with the help of her then-smaller mount, Tuk-Tuk.

> **CHAMBER OF THE DRAGON GEM, HEART**

- She enters the Chamber of the Dragon Gem, guarded by a silhouetted guardian.
  - There is a glowing blue Gem on a pedestal in the center of the room, the same one as pictured in the map in the current day.
  - The guardian calls Raya by name (establishing her name to the audience), and announces that he won't let her step one foot into the inner circle platform where the Gem is.
  - The guardian never unsheathes his sword — we're saving epic reveal for later.
- They fight it out
  - Raya addresses the guardian as "Chief Benja" of the Heart tribe
- Chief Benja would taunt Raya by saying aloud his moves ahead of time. Raya says she doesn't trust him, moving oppositely. But Chief Benja always tells the truth, which causes Raya to fail her blocks and attacks.
- Ultimately, Benja disarms her. However, Raya had won: she had one toe on the inner circle platform.
  - Chief Benja congratulates her daughter, revealing to the audience that he is her father who is training her.
- Benja awards Raya's success by promoting her to Guardian of the Dragon Gem, as her ancestors before her.
- This sequence was quite fun, especially the reveal that the masked guardian is her father, and then that Raya beats him and gets promoted.

```screenplay
YOUNG RAYA
Anyone hoping to steal the dragon gem now has to face the fury of the TWO baddest blades in all the lands.

BENJA
I'm glad you feel prepared, dewdrop, because the other lands... they're on their way here as we speak.

YOUNG RAYA
They are?! Right NOW?!

BENJA
Yes. And we must prepare to meet them.
```

- We end the scene ambiguously there, as if the other lands are about to lay siege just as they finished their training. And jump straight to:

#### Present: Raya's current goal, ready to fight

> **TAIL LANDSCAPE - DUSK (PRESENT)**

- It's approaching sundown.
- The rider sees a purple energy just behind a nearby hill. She quickly veers in the opposite direction.
- The rider then spots a small camp of wasteland nomads.
  - The camp is built on top of a small, pitiful water stream.
- The rider pulls down her face mask, and it's obviously adult Raya!
- Raya glances at her map. She points at her current location via a nearby landmark, and finds that the camp's location is over a circled river that is not checked off yet.
- The rider dismounts, slouching bent-over and dragging her steps, her mount the same.
- She approaches the camp, but a few figures notice her, and run out towards her.
  - She checks her sidearm — yes, Chief Benja's whip-sword is there and ready.

### Kumandra party

#### Past: Benja's party

> **PALACE KITCHEN, HEART - DAY (PRESENT)**

- With Benja's trailing sentence, "We must prepare to meet them. Are you ready to face the other lands?"
- Raya introduces the lands, with flashcard-style overlays for each
  - "We're from the tribe of Heart. Our rainforest rains all the time, which makes us the best for defending the Dragon Gem against the Druun."
  - "Second, Tail. A vast limestone expanse, made up of a wide network of villages of skilled navigators and infiltrators."
  - "Third, Talon. A floating market famous for fast deals and fighters with even faster hands."
  - "Fourth, Spine. A frigid, bamboo mountain guarded by exceptionally fierce warriors and impenetrable fortress."
  - "Fang, our most cunning enemy. An advanced city of scholars and builders, making their assassins frighteningly intelligent and sneaky."
- Raya, "And we're going to use your secret weapon to defeat them, once-and-for-all, right?"
  - "That's right, dewdrop." Benja turns to a table as he constructs a stew: "Shrimp paste from Tail, palm sugar from Talon, bamboo shoots from Spine, chilis from Fang, and lemongrass from Heart… my secret weapon is a Kumandra feast."
- Raya is perplexed?? "Are we poisoning them?"
  - "No tribe can survive alone anymore. This is first step to unite the five lands in the line of ten chiefs, after The Great Division."
- "But dad, what about all my training to become Guardian of the Dragon Gem? Who are we guarding against? Not the Druun, since it's always raining here."
  - "While we want to do the right thing, we can't be sure that the other tribes might try something selfish. They think the Gem magically grants us prosperity."
- "That's ridiculous. It doesn't do that… does it?"
  - "They assume it does, just like we assume things about them. (offers a bowl of soup) Raya, there’s a reason why each land is named after a part of the dragon. We were once unified harmoniously as one. Kumandra."
- "That's ancient history, ba."
  - "But it doesn’t have to be. Listen, if we don’t stop and learn to trust one another again, it’s only a matter of time before we tear each other apart before the actual Druun monsters do. This isn’t the world I want you to live in."
- Raya nods.
  - Benja: "I believe that we can be One Kumandra again. Even if I have my second baddest blade in the land to offer a bit of wise precaution… someone has to take the first step. Trust me."

#### Present: Tail trusts no one

> **NOMAD CAMP OUTSKIRTS, TAIL - NIGHT (PRESENT)**

- Three people from the camp arrive to meet Raya
  - They are armed with a spear and shield
  - They are in a poised stance, wary of this stranger and her huge mount
  - These are the Tail nomads.
- "State your business!" the middle one exclaims. She's holding a lantern, it's getting dark.
  - Raya: "I am Rahmidah, daughter of Hazim, tribe of Tail. We fled here after my village was destroyed by the Druun… I know we don't trust each other, but I just need to set up camp for the night."
  - The nomad is suspicious. "I've never heard of the family name 'Hazim'. Besides, you're at the far end of Tail, why aren't you heading towards the other tribes? Fang has their intricate aqueducts, Spine has their mighty fortress, Talon has their busy floating market. You'd be better off even in Heart than here in this dried-up forsaken land of Tail."
  - "Tail is supposed to be the one tribe that help their own tribe people."
  - "Our own brother stole all our family wealth, and ran away to Talon. One Kumandra? Hah!"
- Raya: "I will set up camp there by that rock. It's 200 cubits away from your camp."
  - "You are too close to our river. We don't trust you. Leave us, or we will attack."
- "I will fight to make camp. But let's both agree that fighting would cost us both resources that we don't have. I don't even want to camp so close to you, I don't trust you either. So I'll be gone in the morning. Take these lemongrass herbs as a gift of peace. Or rather, a gift of non-aggression."
  - They whisper amongst themselves, "Lemongrass! They're so rare since Heart fell to the Druun!"
- The nomads warily take the lemongrass and back off, returning to their own camp, very on edge. "Don't come near us, we won't come near you."

#### Past: Cultural exchange

> **BRIDGE, HEART - DAY (PAST)**

- Benja and Raya stand on the end of the main bridge leading into Heart. Four distinct factions stand arranged before them. Benja welcomes them.
  - Tail Chief: Nice speech, Chief Benja, but why’d you really bring us here? Are you gonna rob us?
  - Dang Hai (Talon Chief): "Why would he need to rob us? The land of Heart already has everything. *And what is there to rob? Even our rivers are drying up!*"(remember this)
  - Spine Chief: It’s easy to champion "Kumandra" when you hold the mightiest weapon in all the lands.
  - Everyone argues.
- Raya steps forward towards the only other kid.
  - The kid steps forward from behind a woman. "I'm Namaari. Daughter of the chieftess of Fang."
  - They fangirl together and connect over Naamari's dragon pendant.
  - "Do you want to come eat my dad's Kumandra stew?"
  - They go in together
  - The adults see this, lower their defenses, and the chiefs decide to cross over too.

> **PALACE COURTROOM, HEART - DUSK**

- Later in the palace courtroom: it's crowded but no one is mixing around.
- On Young Raya and Namaari:
  - they chatter about their shared princess-ship.
  - Namaari takes a huge bite of the stew: she groans in delight
  - we see a bit of Naamari's Fang intelligence and sharpness
  - Naamari admits this is her first time having such a stew with so many different ingredients. Raya says she has this every day.
    - Namaari explains that Heart trades with other tribes, but the other tribes don't really mix around
    - It's not just stew, it's the technology, the architecture, the knowledge. Just look at Tail, they're still so backwards.
    - Raya exclaims! "That's why Heart seems so prosperous compared to the other tribes: it's not that the Gem gives some magic favour to Heart, but it's that Heart trusts the other tribes."
- Namaari then brings up they're both Sisu fans
  - Naamari: You know, Fang legend says she’s still out there. I'm not supposed to show you this, but…
  - Naamari pulls out a Scroll that she says she's not supposed to show
  - (It's the same scroll that adult Raya is using as her map!)

> **NARRATED OVER STYLISTIC PUPPETRY**

- Namaari is the one to retell the legend, as it comes to life stylistically in Southeast Asian-inspired puppetry:
  - Kumandra used to be lush when humans lived harmoniously alongside dragons - magical creatures who brought us water and rain and peace.
  - Then, the Druun monsters attacked: multiplying as they consumed life and turned everyone they touched into stone.
  - The dragons fought for us but lost.
  - Finally, 500 years ago, the mighty Sisudatu, the last dragon, concentrated all her magic into a gem and defeated the Druun.
    - Everyone that was turned to stone came back… except the dragons.
    - All that was left of Sisu was her gem.
  - Instead of uniting humanity, people fought to possess the last of dragon magic.
  - Borders were drawn. Kumandra divided. We all became enemies.
  - The Gem was secured by Heart for the past 350 years, and they prospered.

> **PALACE COURTROOM, HEART**

- Namaari expresses, "Though the Druun are no more, yet all Kumandra isn't sharing the Gem like it was way before. It's paradise for Heart, but not for us other tribes. Not that the Gem is magical, but sharing the Gem together is the first step in being united in recognition of what Sisu has done, equally for every person in every tribe. That's what Sisu would have wanted."
- Raya points out on the scroll, that Sisu sleeps dormant at a river's end.
  - Naamari says, if they could ever track down every river, they could bring back Sisu, and reunite Kumandra.
  - Raya looks at her dad. Yes.
- Namaari gives Raya her dragon pendant necklace.
  - It's a part of Naamari's mother's sceptre.
- Raya says, "Together we'll track down Sisu one day, but I know what we can do today. Follow me."

#### Present: Raya lies to find Sisu

> **RAYA'S CAMP, TAIL - NIGHT (PRESENT)**

- Raya leaves Tuk-tuk and her supplies back in her own camp, and stealthily creeps towards the outskirts of the nomad camp

> **NOMAD CAMP, TAIL**

- She expects guards at every corner — none. She easily slips through their camp.

> **CAVERN, NOMAD CAMP, TAIL**

- She slips into a cavern where the stream ends
- She doesn't waste any time. She does a whole ritual.
  - "Sisudatu… I don’t know if you’re listening. I’m searching every river to find you. I really need your help. I made a mistake. I trusted someone I shouldn’t have. And now the world’s broken."
  - Raya sits. And waits. And waits. Nothing happens. It's a bust.
- The nomad leader appears behind her: "Your name is Raya."
  - The other nomads hold up Raya's supplies and have Tuk-tuk guarded at spear-point. They had raided Raya's camp.
  - The nomad leader continues, "Daughter of Benja. Tribe of Heart. Or what's left of it."

### Betrayal causes Druun

#### Past: Raya vs. Naamari

> **CHAMBER OF THE DRAGON GEM, HEART - NIGHT (PAST)**

- Young Raya and Naamari enter the Chamber of the Dragon Gem.
- "Thank you for sharing the Gem with me."
  - "It's what Sisu would have wanted."
- Suddenly, Naamari strikes out at Raya.
  - Raya dodges, but a branch scratches her bare calf.
  - Naamari smirks, "Padipepper brambles. Makes your muscles sleepy. 100% organic Fang produce."
- Raya limps. "What are you doing?"
  - "I'm doing what's right for Fang."
- They take out their weapons and fight viciously.
- Raya does get the upper hand, even with her cripple, and knocks Naamari backwards.
- Naamari just smirks and shoots a whistling firework through the ceiling opening.

> **PALACE COURTYARD, HEART**

- At the palace, Benja is diplomat-ing with Virana.
  - "Chief Virana! I hope our daughters' newfound friendship will foster a special bond between Heart and Fang."
- Through a window, the firework explodes and illuminates the night sky.
- Benja turns back, and Fang is gone. The other tribes start to catch on.

#### Present: Confrontation

> **CAVERN, NOMAD CAMP, TAIL (PRESENT)**

- Raya: "You already planned to raid my camp while I was asleep."
  - Nomad: "And you already planned to sneak into our precious river."
- "Look, I just wanted to find Sisu from the myths, and you wouldn't have let me near your river stream. She's not here, I've done no harm, so I will leave your family alone and be on my way."
  - The nomad leader blocks her with a spear.
  - "Not so fast. You think we'll just let you go? You lied to us. We're taking your jade pieces and your animal mount…"
  - A nomad interrupts: "And her father's chain-whip-sword-weapon-thing! It's so epic!"
  - "..and your Dragon Gem piece, please. And *then* you'll be on your way. You can take back your lemongrass too, it tastes nothing like they said."
- Raya: "But you've never seen lemongrass before, you wouldn't be able to tell if it were actually padipepper?"
  - The nomads start to droop their limbs. Raya smirks.
- A small crack forms in the ground…

#### Past: Druun unleashed

> **CHAMBER OF THE DRAGON GEM, HEART - NIGHT (PAST)**

- Young Raya and Namaari continue fighting, but Fang soldiers enter the room.
  - Raya straightens her back, ready to fight to the death with her newfound anger.
- SWOOSH! Benja repels into the room, dispatches a dozen different adversaries. His sword turns into a cool grappling whip which he uses to drive everyone back.
  - This is the same whip-sword that adult Raya has.
  - "You will not set foot on the Dragon Gem’s inner circle."
- The soldiers of the other tribes file into the room, in awe of the Gem.
  - "Fang's making a play for the Gem!"
  - "We should take it for Spine, now!"
  - Everyone readies their weapons.
  - Benja readies too, but sees young Raya in the reflection of his sword…
- Benja announces, "We have a choice. We can tear each other apart, or we can come together and build a better world. It’s not too late. I still believe we can be Kumandra again…"
- Benja unsheathes his sword.
  - Tension fills the air. Eyes dart around, who's making the first move?
- An arrow strikes Benja in the leg. He crumples.
  - "Ba!" Raya cries.
  - Everyone rushes in.
- Hands grab at the Gem, until…
  - The Gem crashes onto the ground, breaking into five pieces.
  - BOOM! The ground shakes, the water in the chamber recedes, the floor opens up.
  - From the broken Earth, a purple evil Druun monster emerges.
  - Benja: "Druun…"
- A soldier rushes in towards the Druun, slashing at it:
  - the blade makes but a small wound in the semi-permeable creature
- The Druun engulfs the soldier
  - turning him into stone
  - and duplicating
- It takes 3-4 more tough warriors to fell the original Druun,
  - but by then, they all turned to stone
- A Druun rushes towards Benja and Raya
  - Benja rushes towards a Gem piece and holds it up
  - it repels the Druun
- A mad scramble ensues as each tribe is snatches up a Gem piece for themselves
- A Druun pursues, but is recoiled by dripping water
  - Benja shouts: "Everyone to the river!"
- In the cave, the waterfalls start to dry up…

#### Present: Druun unleashed pt. 2

> **CAVERN, NOMAD CAMP, TAIL - NIGHT (PRESENT)**

- Raya collects her items back from each disabled nomad, packing them and readying to leave. "You'll be back to normal by sunrise. Sorry for the inconvenience."
  - The nomads try to chase after her, but they are slow like zombies.

> **NOMAD CAMP, TAIL**

- She exits the cavern and climbs up onto Tuk-tuk, surveying the map…
- Suddenly, a purple tendril breaks out from the ground and wraps around her foot. A Druun.
- Raya swings her whip-sword, the blade now infused with Heart's Gem shard. It effortlessly tears through the Druun, compared to the ineffective simple weapons before.
- She fights a few, easily with the Gem-fused weapon.
- There are some purple glows that come out from the cavern: glows that meant someone was being petrified.

#### Past: Sacrifice

> **BRIDGE, HEART - NIGHT (PAST)**

- Heart is plunged into chaos
- People flee out of the city via the main bridge
- Benja is very injured
  - The road ahead is too far
  - The bridge shakes and a Druun approaches
- Benja hands his Gem shard to Raya. "Raya, don’t give up on them. Make things right for Heart. I love you, my dewdrop."
- Benja pushes Raya off the bridge into the water with his Gem Piece and whip-sword
  - A Druun passes through Benja, turning him to stone
  - A current carries young screaming Raya away to safety…

#### Present: Just another Tuesday

> **NOMAD CAMP, TAIL - NIGHT (PRESENT)**

- The Druun retreat from Raya, back into the ground.
- Raya rushes back into the cavern: everyone's turned to stone.
  - But Raya's numb expressionless to all of it. She takes a moment, than comes out
- She raids the ghost-town camp, gets up, and gets on her way.
- Business as usual. She heads to the next spot on the map.

### Present: Epilogue

> **TAIL LANDSCAPE - DAY (PRESENT)**

- A woman on a Serlot (some large tiger-wolf hybrid) dismounts and enters the cavern.
  - She inspects the carnage left behind my the Druun
  - She picks up the Padipepper from the ground.
  - Some more armour-clad people on Serlots step out behind her.
  - "What are your orders, Princess Namaari?"

# RAYA Episode 2 - Tail

## Episode 2 - Tail

### Setup Sisu and Namaari

#### Introduce Sisu

> **SHIPWRECK CAVERN, TAIL - DAY (PRESENT)**

- Chyron: TAIL - TWO WEEKS LATER
- Raya and Tuk-Tuk follow a river, which has now gone down to a small trickle. It flows into an old wrecked ship, surrounded by old whale bones, trash, etc.
- She enters inside the shipwreck
- She repeats the ritual.
  - "Sisudatu… I don’t know if you’re listening. I’ve searched every river to find you. And now I’m here at the very last one. I trusted too much, and I broke the world… Sisudatu, I just really… really want my *ba* back. Please."
- Magic happens, Sisu appears!
- Raya catches Sisu up on the events of the past 15 years…
  - "Oh, oh, oh my. Oh, this is bad. This is bad. I’ve been asleep for 500 years, you brought back the Druun, and none of my brothers and sisters came back? Why didn’t they come back?" #todo
- Let's skip the part about unique individual dragon magic. It's meh and doesn't really add much.
- Sisu explains, they can still reassemble the Gem, destroy the Druun, and bring everyone back.
- Sisu confirms that she is drawn to the Gem pieces and can direct Raya to each piece

#### Naamari pinch

> **HILLTOP, TAIL**

- On a hilltop, Naamari inspects the footprints of Tuk-tuk. Her own Serlot sniffs the tracks. Four Fang soldiers on their own Serlots flank her.
- One of them point out that:
 1. Tail is infested with Druun, Raya's good as stone
 2. Retrieving the scroll isn't worth the risk
- Namaari turns to him, sharply spitting, "Go back home." The soldiers side-eye amongst themselves.
  - Namaari hops onto her mount, "Or, you can follow me and make things right for Fang."
  - (ooo ambiguous)
- Namaari pushes her mount onwards, leaving the rest of them to continue on.

### Getting the Tail gem vs Namaari

#### Tail Temple

> **TEMPLE, TAIL**

- Sisu leads Raya on Tuk-tuk to a limestone temple in a cave of a cliff
- Raya explains: each piece was claimed by each of the chiefs of the five lands.
  - We get a splitscreen, showing each tribe chief holding a weapon that has been embedded with their Gem piece.
    - Heart's Gem is embedded into Chief Benja's whip-sword
    - Fang's Gem is embedded into Chief Virana's scepter-trishula
    - Talon's Gem is embedded into Chief Dang Hai's karambit
    - Spine's Gem in a bamboo spear
    - Tail's Gem in a kujang
- Sisu questions why she is dressed like a human.
  - Raya says they have to disguise so they don't attract attention.
  - Sisu rebuffs, "But don't people love us, after all we've done for them? Won't the tribes finally unite if they see me?"
  - Raya replies, "The other tribes all have bad people, like Namaari. Trust me."
- Sisu exclaims they should have brought a welcome gift!
  - Raya mockingly waves, "I have loads of lemongrass to trade with, I've seen people go nuts over some common Heart herb. But this temple is abandoned."
- They work through the temple; and avoid traps.
  - Sisu, "Wow, you're real good at slipping and sliding."
  - Raya: "Yea, my dad trained me for this with our own version at home."
  - Sisu stops, confused. "These traps wouldn't stop Druun."
  - Raya replies, "They're to stop people."
  - Raya also remarks that people from Tail are naturally good navigators/infiltrators, so these traps are totally in-character
- They encounter a room that would be impossible for normal people
  - this is why no one has ever stolen the unguarded Tail Gem artefact
  - Perhaps they have to squeeze through some narrow doorway into a room with a very high ceiling and slippery walls. It's impossible to bring ladders or scaffolds of some kind — there would be leftover structures in the room to show that it had been attempted before
    - Sisu is able to scale up the wall with Raya on her back
- We skip the awkward setup dialogue about Sisu being "good at swimming".

> **THRONE ROOM, TEMPLE, TAIL**

- They enter the temple throne room, and see the dead Tail chieftess.
  - "Oof," remarks Sisu, "that's what happens when you hold on too tight."
  - They retrieve Tail's Gem weapon artefact: either a kujang.
- Sisu touches Tail's Gem artefact, and turns into a human version of herself.
  - "Whoa, what did you do? Can you undo it?"
  - "I don't know, it just happened! But now that you don't have to disguise me, the rest should be easy!"
  - "This one was easy, but the rest of them are being held by a bunch of no-good binturis."

#### Fang Ambush

- "I'm sorry I made you feel that way."
  - Raya turns around; it's Namaari, alone, on a landing a stone's throw away.
  - Raya grits, "Naamari."
  - "Oh!" Sisu exclaims, "You're the one who backstabbed Raya fifteen years ago!"
- "I'm sorry, Raya. I was a kid, just wanting to please my mother."
  - "Oh, please. You make the worst rumours we heard about Fang sound like children's fables. You caused the world… to come to this! You took away my father."
- "I… did a wrong thing. And I realised I needed to make things right. So I started to track down the rivers to find Sisu, according to the Scroll… then, four years ago, the scroll was stolen from my possession by a woman and her Pandolin. So I've been trying to find you to aid you in your quest."
  - "I'm never stepping foot in Fang again. Fang is the last tribe I'd work with, and you're the last person from Fang I'd trust."
- Raya continues, "Besides, I've already found Sisu."
  - Sisu waves. "That's me, Sisu! Raya, she says she's sorry. We should work with her! Then we can get the Gem artefact from Fang, then that's just two more to go!"
- Namaari: "Raya… I don't know who is this crazy person you've convinced to be Sisu… but she's right. It looks like you're collecting all the five Gem artefacts, how do you expect reassemble the Dragon Gem if you only have four? Unless…"
  - "Don't worry about the gem pieces, Namaari. Worry about the landslide."
  - "What landsli-"
- Raya triggers a bobby trap, causing some loose rocks to fall onto Namaari. The temple collapses.
  - Namaari's caught in the landslide and needs to retreat.
  - Raya grabs Sisu by the hand. "Run!"

> **TEMPLE, TAIL**

- Raya and Sisu mount on Tuk-tuk, and pull away
  - the four Fang soldiers outside launch in hot pursuit of Raya on their Serlots
  - "See, Sisu!" Raya shouts, "Namaari had backup! We can't trust Fang!"

#### Fang Escape Sequence

> **TAIL LANDSCAPE**

- Namaari joins the ranks of her soldiers on her own Serlot
- Let's extend this huge chase sequence by adding some more mythical elements!
  - Perhaps some Druun pop up. Namaari is delayed as she stops her chase to defend her people. She can actually take on at least one Druun herself with normal weapons.
  - Raya reinforces her point, "Naamari just wants to steal the other tribes' Gem pieces to make Fang stronger!"
- Eventually, the chase leads them to a narrow cliffside, with a large lake basin below
  - Sisu exclaims, "The Druun and the Serlot mounts (large hybrid cats) are both afraid of water!"
  - Raya hard rejects the idea, "No, we need another way."
  - But as Namaari gains distance, close enough to touch them…
  - Sisu pulls the reigns on Tuk-tuk, veering him sideways and hard launching them (Tuk-tuk, Sisu, and Raya) a good distance off and into the the water below
  - The Serlots halt completely, refusing to go into the water

> **LAKE, TAIL**

- SPLASH!
- PANIC. Raya is flailing all about. She takes in gulps of water
  - Quick FLASHBACKS of when her dad pushed her off the bridge
- Sisu can't transform into dragon form
  - (She has to remain human so that they can't just mount on Sisu and swim off, they will need a boat)
  - she enjoys the swim
  - but she has human limbs. she tries swimming like a dragon, which kind of works
- Sisu then notices Raya struggling. She fetches her and drags her upright
  - it's a battle, trying to save a flailing person in water. Sisu's that good
    - "Hey! Hey! Stop resisting. I'm here to help."
  - Tuk-tuk doggy paddles in place, afloat, but unable to move
  - Sisu calls out to him, "I'll come back for you, Tuk-tuk!"
- Now as Raya catches her breaths, we see that the lake is a dock for a dozen-or-so fishing ships, mostly unoccupied
- Sisu swims over to the nearest boat and tosses Raya aboard
  - Raya flails around, confirming that she's touching land again
  - Sisu swims back towards Tuk-tuk
  - Back on the boat, a shadow is cast over Raya
  - Raya, soaking wet, looks up:

#### Establishing Boun and the Boat

> **SHRIMPORIUM SHIP, LAKE, TAIL**

- There's a Tail kid, 15 years old-ish. Frying wok in one hand, spatula in another.
- "Welcome to the Kumandra-famous Shrimp-orium! My name is Boun, I’ll be your server today! Shrimp--"
  - Raya, still coughing out water, "Where's the captain?"
  - "I am the captain! Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. There's shrimp barbecued shrimp congee, boiled shrimp congee, broiled shrimp congee…"
- As Boun yaps on, Raya looks over her shoulder: Namaari's Fang squad has already made their way towards the coast. There's a boardwalk that extends a short while, and the Serlots just have to hop across a few ships to get to the Shrimporium. T-2 minutes.
  - Raya, finally getting her breath, speaks over him: "Can you just drive the boat out a little bit -- but not too far out!"
  - Boun: "Oh, I see, you want the dining-at-sea Tail experience. It'll cost you extra!"
  - Raya glances around for people at the other ships.
  - Boun: "Sorry, until sunset, I'm the only sailor in this lake who can serve you!"
  - "What, why?!"
  - Boun, hesitant to elaborate,"…because today is Midsummer (Sumer Solstice) during the fourth leap year? And the men don't drive their boats out or do any work, because they must spend time with their family today? -- And I'm not sixteen yet."
  - "Oh…"
- Boun double-takes. "Wait, you don't know. You're not from Tail. Sorry, I can't serve you."
  - Raya: "Nono, I am Tail! Yes, I'd like the out-on-the-ocean experience."
  - Boun: "Momma always said --"
- VOOSH! A big splash of water, and the boat tilts as Tuk-tuk climbs aboard.
  - Boun: "WHA-WHAT IS THAT! Please, don't hurt me!"
  - Raya: "Don't freak out! That's my pet mount, Tuk-tuk, he's a Pandolin. He's friendly."
- Tuk-tuk uses his mouth to pull a human hand out of the water -- it's Sisu.
  - Sisu: "Hiya! The water is *so* refreshing on a Midsummer noon --"
  - Boun: "Are you Tail?"
  - Raya tries to mouth-signal to Sisu…
  - Sisu spins around and checks her bum, thinking she hasn't shifted back properly, "Ah! I still have it on me! Ah. No tail. Just a normal-shaped human bootie."
- Boun: "Please, I can't serve you if you're not Tail. I can't even trust Tail."
  - Sisu: "We have gifts! Raya, you said you have lemongrass?"
  - Boun hops over, "Lemongrass?! No way! I thought they were extinct!"
  - Namaari's Serlot starts racing down the boardwalk towards them
  - Raya shoves a fistful into Boun's hands. "Drive!"
- Boun stashes the lemongrass in a basket and hops into the driver's seat, and launches the boat full-throttle
  - it's not fast, but it's enough
  - the Serlots start jumping onto ships to close the gap
  - but the gang narrowly make their escape

#### Fang Resolution

> **DOCKS, LAKE, TAIL**

- One of the Fang soldiers notes that
 1. Raya can now escape anywhere, they won't keep up with the boat
 2. they'll likely go to Talon next for the next Gem piece
- Namaari says they're not following;
  - Talon is strong and dangerous territory, we'll intercept after
  - She chooses one of her elite soldiers to follow and spy on Raya #payme
    - not to interfere. Just collect info
  - they need to head back to Fang to talk with her mother, Chief Virana
  - she needs to know what Raya is trying to do
    - (Namaari really wasn't supposed to show the scroll!)

### Settling into the Shrimporium

#### Raya's trauma

> **SHRIMPORIUM SHIP, LAKE, TAIL**

- Raya looks out: Namaari's squad retreats behind a mountain
- Raya peeks at Boun: his hands works fast with a chopping knife, slicing up the prawns and vegetables quite expertly
- Raya peers over the boat. She bites her lip in discomfort, and scurries back.
  - Sisu notices this: "Heya. What was that back there?"
  - They whisper out of earshot of Boun.
  - Raya deflects. "Yea. You didn't listen to me, I said not to go into the water. We'll dock as soon as possible and continue to Talon on Tuk-tuk."
  - "Those cat things can out-speed Tuk-tuk. If I had control of my full dragon power, I could fly us wherever, but a boat is still faster for long-distance travel!"
    - Tuk-tuk lounges lazily, exhausted from the previous chase
    - Sisu: "Besides, we're also safer from the Druun on the water."
  - Raya: "I never learnt how to drive a boat, and we can't be completely sure we can trust Boun, or any other sailor."
  - Sisu: "You've tracked down every river's end in Kumandra, but you never learnt how to sail? Kumandra isn't that big. If you learnt how to sail, you would've taken much less than 4 years."
    - Raya, "You got me, I never learnt how to swim."
  - Sisu: "Then why didn't you start? And come to think of it, if you assembled people to spread out, finding all the river's ends would've taken less than a year!"
    - Raya: "You can't trust anyone!"
  - Sisu: "If you want the tribes to trust each other to unite under One Kumandra, you need to start by trusting me."
- Raya sighs, downcast.
  - with voiced-over'ed FLASHBACKS:
  - "When my dad threw me into the water, to save me, the last thing I saw was him turning to stone. I wanted to cry, scream, wail. But when the river kept trying to drown me?"
    - We see young Raya spasming in the water like adult Raya previously
      - never dying, never living
    - the river goes on for a long while…
  - "So when I fall into deep waters, my body does this *thing*"
    - NEXT FLASHBACK: Raya, a bit older now, trying to jump across the river, but falls in. She spasms again.
- Back to present: "Every time, I'm reminded how my dad should've never given his trust to the other tribes."
- Sisu: "I'm sorry I pushed us in. But Boun, he's just a kid, he's not the Namaari who hurt you all those years ago. Namaari now isn't the same Namaari who hurt you all those years ago either. It seems a little unfair to automatically assume the worst."
- Raya swings her head around, deliberating. "I've been unfair to Boun, but Namaari is a different story."

#### Late Lunch

- "Food's ready!" calls Boun
  - Raya sits up and goes over to Boun.
  - "And now, for the legendary garnish!"
    - "Wait!!"
  - Raya swaps out the herbs in Boun's basket (which are actually padipepper) with a whole head of actual lemongrass from her satchel
  - Boun: "The colour's different."
    - Raya covers up: "These ones are fresher, they just grow like that."
    - Boun takes the actual lemongrass, expertly slices them up, and distributes it into the congee
    - "It's about the theatrics, the customers love the theatrics!"
  - Boun takes a test scoop — he dramatically falls to his knees in awe
    - "WOW, I never thought shrimp congee could get any better."
- Boun serves up a bowl for Raya first
  - Boun notices that Raya's apprehensive
    - "You haven't even tasted it yet"
    - "Oh, it's just that. I've lived on my own dried jackfruit for the past 15 years of my life… Not to say you've poisoned my food! Haha! You wouldn't poison my food! I wouldn't poison your food! Hahahahaha….."
    - Sisu: "Quit being weird and eat the congee."
    - Raya: "…all I'm saying is that you never know! You know!"
  - Sisu forces a spoonful of congee in her mouth
    - Raya protests at first, but then she surrenders, groaning at how good it is, just like Young Namaari in Episode 1 tasting the full stew
    - Raya mumbles: "I haven't tasted food like this in 15 years…"
  - Boun serves up the rest
- Sisu: "Hey, Boun, I was wondering. If it's ok with you, we'd like to sail with you to Talon."
  - "Talon! Another tribe. They're not very far, but wow… I've never left Tail all my life."
  - Raya: "If not, just drop us off at the next stop, we'll just continue on Tuk-tuk --"
  - "Alright, I'll take you to Talon! They'll have a lot of ingredients to level up my game!"
- Boun: "But first I'll need to make a quick stop on the way. There's something I need to do."
  - "What is it?"
  - "Oh. Just family matters. Midsummer things. Anyways, shrimp is…"
  - Raya squints suspiciously

#### Namaari interlude

> **DRAGON GRAVEYARD, WILDERNESS - DUSK**

- Namaari and her soldiers pass through the field.
  - Petrified dragons lay in heroic poses, but look merely hand-sculpted
- Namaari solemnly pays her respects, more so than the others

#### The Visit

> **SHRIMPORIUM SHIP, LAKE, TAIL - NIGHT**

- They're now out of Tail
- Sisu and Tuk-tuk
- Boun visiting petrified family
- Raya realises she made a mistake
- They return to the boat, Druun damaged the boat. they must find repairs at Talon
- Raya replaces padipepper with lemongrass?

#### What are Druun?

- Raya as she stares at the purple glow and movement of druun ominously sweep through the mangrove trees on the shoreline.
- Boun: You know, during the day, you can almost forget they’re here, but at night… (clearly unnerved) This is why I never leave the boat.
- Boun: What are Druun?
- Sisu: A plague born from human discord, they’ve always been here - waiting for a moment of weakness to attack. They’re like the opposite of dragons, instead of bringing water and life to the world, they’re like a relentless fire that consumes everything in its wake until there’s nothing left except ash and stone.
- Boun: They took my family.
  - Sisu: They took mine too.
  - Two of them stare off into the distance on the back of the boat
- Raya looks on. But she doesn't join them.

# RAYA Episode 3 - Talon

## Ideas

- switcheroo fake artefacts, how to trust the real one?
- Boun and Sisu on the hunt for a ship component fix part, that broke by the Druun because Raya doubted Boun was going offshore to memoralize parents
- dragonfruit

This one goes mostly the same as the original story. So I'll just hit off the main plot points.

## Enter Talon

- Raya enters Talon, the floating marketplace rife with commerce and infamous for thievery.
  - She disallows Sisu nor Boun from coming along.
- She encounters a lone child, and offers help
  - the toddler turns out to be a con-artist-baby, who steals her satchel with the help of three ongi-monkeys
  - Raya loses her satchel containing the Gem artefacts
- Raya eventually tracks them down, and retrieves her satchel
  - but seeing the toddler and the monkeys downcast, Raya enlists their help to infiltrate the Talon palace
- Meanwhile, Sisu goes to the market. She has no coins, nothing to lose.
  - Sisu accidentally stirs up trouble with some locals
  - An old local lady comes to her defence
  - She also offers to take her to the Talon chief
-
-

# RAYA Episode 4 - Spine

## Ideas

- The gem isn't a weapon! Well now it really is made into weapons, and actually helps against Druun.
- Spine does need their super-staff to survive, and are willing to give it up on Sisu's authenticity
- some
- Jianzi / đá cầu / sipa / capteh
  - except it's like combat juggling
  - each team has to keep "alive" their dacau, whilst trying to take down the other teams'
  - maybe they have three each, and can use them to hit others out of the air
    - the lighter women are launched into the air to spike opponents' balls out
  - soft combat is allowed!
  - there's a 2m deep pond in the center of the arena
    - Spine players abuse Raya not willing to cross into the pond
    - Raya must admit her fear of water,
      - or maybe be willing to stand underwater to boost her shorter teammates like Noi to land a spike
  - Namaari brings chilis from Fang to help with the cold
- lol one of those doors with an eye slider, where you have to answer a prompt with the correct passphrase
- they don't believe in dragons lol
- Raya's the avatar of the worst traits of the five nations lol
  - Tail: generally untrusting
  - Talon: false deception
  - Spine: indifferent independence
  - Heart: champion conspiring
  - Fang: ruthless, internal trust
- they find a water redirection
