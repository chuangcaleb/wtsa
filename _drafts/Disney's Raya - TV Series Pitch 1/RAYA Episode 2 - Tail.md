# RAYA Episode 2 - Tail

## Episode 2 - Tail

### Notes

- In adding depth to Sisu's characterization, I'd like for her to use old-timey terms and a foreign language to describe things and places. Kind of like ATLA's Aang saying "flameo hotman"! Which is way better than Sisu having some Gen Z slang.

### Setup Sisu and Namaari

#### Introduce Sisu

> **SHIPWRECK CAVERN, TAIL - DAY (PRESENT)**

- Chyron: TAIL - TWO WEEKS LATER
- Raya and Tuk-Tuk follow a river, which has now gone down to a small trickle. It flows into an old wrecked ship, surrounded by old whale bones, trash, etc.
- She enters inside the shipwreck
- She repeats the ritual.
	- "Sisudatu… I don’t know if you’re listening. I’ve searched every river to find you. And now I’m here at the very last one. I trusted too much, and I broke the world… Sisudatu, I just really… really want my *ba* back. Please."
- Magic happens, Sisu appears!
- Raya catches Sisu up on the events of the past 15 years…
	- "Oh, oh, oh my. Oh, this is bad. This is bad. I’ve been asleep for 500 years, you brought back the Druun, and none of my brothers and sisters came back? Why didn’t they come back?" #todo
- Let's skip the part about unique individual dragon magic. It's meh and doesn't really add much.
- Sisu explains, they can still reassemble the Gem, destroy the Druun, and bring everyone back.
- Sisu confirms that she is drawn to the Gem pieces and can direct Raya to each piece

#### Naamari pinch

> **HILLTOP, TAIL**

- On a hilltop, Naamari inspects the footprints of Tuk-tuk. Her own Serlot sniffs the tracks. Four Fang soldiers on their own Serlots flank her.
- One of them point out that:
	1. Tail is infested with Druun, Raya's good as stone
	2. Retrieving the scroll isn't worth the risk
- Namaari turns to him, sharply spitting, "Go back home." The soldiers side-eye amongst themselves.
	- Namaari hops onto her mount, "Or, you can follow me and make things right for Fang."
	- (ooo ambiguous)
- Namaari pushes her mount onwards, leaving the rest of them to continue on.

### Getting the Tail gem vs Namaari

#### Tail Temple

> **TEMPLE, TAIL**

- Sisu leads Raya on Tuk-tuk to a limestone temple in a cave of a cliff
- Raya explains: each piece was claimed by each of the chiefs of the five lands.
	- We get a splitscreen, showing each tribe chief holding a weapon that has been embedded with their Gem piece.
		- Heart's Gem is embedded into Chief Benja's whip-sword
		- Fang's Gem is embedded into Chief Virana's scepter-[trishula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trishula)
		- Talon's Gem is embedded into Chief Dang Hai's karambit
		- Spine's Gem in a bamboo spear
		- Tail's Gem in a [kujang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kujang_(weapon))
- Sisu questions why she is dressed like a human.
	- Raya says they have to disguise so they don't attract attention.
	- Sisu rebuffs, "But don't people love us, after all we've done for them? Won't the tribes finally unite if they see me?"
	- Raya replies, "The other tribes all have bad people, like Namaari. Trust me."
- Sisu exclaims they should have brought a welcome gift!
	- Raya mockingly waves, "I have loads of lemongrass to trade with, I've seen people go nuts over some common Heart herb. But this temple is abandoned."
- They work through the temple; and avoid traps.
	- Sisu, "Wow, you're real good at slipping and sliding."
	- Raya: "Yea, my dad trained me for this with our own version at home."
	- Sisu stops, confused. "These traps wouldn't stop Druun."
	- Raya replies, "They're to stop people."
	- Raya also remarks that people from Tail are naturally good navigators/infiltrators, so these traps are totally in-character
- They encounter a room that would be impossible for normal people
	- this is why no one has ever stolen the unguarded Tail Gem artefact
	- Perhaps they have to squeeze through some narrow doorway into a room with a very high ceiling and slippery walls. It's impossible to bring ladders or scaffolds of some kind — there would be leftover structures in the room to show that it had been attempted before
		- Sisu is able to scale up the wall with Raya on her back
- We skip the awkward setup dialogue about Sisu being "good at swimming".

> **THRONE ROOM, TEMPLE, TAIL**

- They enter the temple throne room, and see the dead Tail chieftess.
	- "Oof," remarks Sisu, "that's what happens when you hold on too tight."
	- They retrieve Tail's Gem weapon artefact: either a [kujang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kujang_(weapon)) or a [celurit/sabit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celurit).
- Sisu touches Tail's Gem artefact, and turns into a human version of herself.
	- "Whoa, what did you do? Can you undo it?"
	- "I don't know, it just happened! But now that you don't have to disguise me, the rest should be easy!"
	- "This one was easy, but the rest of them are being held by a bunch of no-good binturis."

#### Fang Ambush

- "I'm sorry I made you feel that way."
	- Raya turns around; it's Namaari, alone, on a landing a stone's throw away.
	- Raya grits, "Naamari."
	- "Oh!" Sisu exclaims, "You're the one who backstabbed Raya fifteen years ago!"
- "I'm sorry, Raya. I was a kid, just wanting to please my mother."
	- "Oh, please. You make the worst rumours we heard about Fang sound like children's fables. You caused the world… to come to this! You took away my father."
- "I… did a wrong thing. And I realised I needed to make things right. So I started to track down the rivers to find Sisu, according to the Scroll… then, four years ago, the scroll was stolen from my possession by a woman and her Pandolin. So I've been trying to find you to aid you in your quest."
	- "I'm never stepping foot in Fang again. Fang is the last tribe I'd work with, and you're the last person from Fang I'd trust."
- Raya continues, "Besides, I've already found Sisu."
	- Sisu waves. "That's me, Sisu! Raya, she says she's sorry. We should work with her! Then we can get the Gem artefact from Fang, then that's just two more to go!"
- Namaari: "Raya… I don't know who is this crazy person you've convinced to be Sisu… but she's right. It looks like you're collecting all the five Gem artefacts, how do you expect reassemble the Dragon Gem if you only have four? Unless…"
	- "Don't worry about the gem pieces, Namaari. Worry about the landslide."
	- "What landsli-"
- Raya triggers a bobby trap, causing some loose rocks to fall onto Namaari. The temple collapses.
	- Namaari's caught in the landslide and needs to retreat.
	- Raya grabs Sisu by the hand. "Run!"

> **TEMPLE, TAIL**

- Raya and Sisu mount on Tuk-tuk, and pull away
	- the four Fang soldiers outside launch in hot pursuit of Raya on their Serlots
	- "See, Sisu!" Raya shouts, "Namaari had backup! We can't trust Fang!"

#### Fang Escape Sequence

> **TAIL LANDSCAPE**

- Namaari joins the ranks of her soldiers on her own Serlot
- Let's extend this huge chase sequence by adding some more mythical elements!
	- Perhaps some Druun pop up. Namaari is delayed as she stops her chase to defend her people. She can actually take on at least one Druun herself with normal weapons.
	- Raya reinforces her point, "Naamari just wants to steal the other tribes' Gem pieces to make Fang stronger!"
- Eventually, the chase leads them to a narrow cliffside, with a large lake basin below
	- Sisu exclaims, "The Druun and the Serlot mounts (large hybrid cats) are both afraid of water!"
	- Raya hard rejects the idea, "No, we need another way."
	- But as Namaari gains distance, close enough to touch them…
	- Sisu pulls the reigns on Tuk-tuk, veering him sideways and hard launching them (Tuk-tuk, Sisu, and Raya) a good distance off and into the the water below
	- The Serlots halt completely, refusing to go into the water

> **LAKE, TAIL**

- SPLASH!
- PANIC. Raya is flailing all about. She takes in gulps of water
	- Quick FLASHBACKS of when her dad pushed her off the bridge
- Sisu can't transform into dragon form
	- (She has to remain human so that they can't just mount on Sisu and swim off, they will need a boat)
	- she enjoys the swim
	- but she has human limbs. she tries swimming like a dragon, which kind of works
- Sisu then notices Raya struggling. She fetches her and drags her upright
	- it's a battle, trying to save a flailing person in water. Sisu's that good
		- "Hey! Hey! Stop resisting. I'm here to help."
	- Tuk-tuk doggy paddles in place, afloat, but unable to move
	- Sisu calls out to him, "I'll come back for you, Tuk-tuk!"
- Now as Raya catches her breaths, we see that the lake is a dock for a dozen-or-so fishing ships, mostly unoccupied
- Sisu swims over to the nearest boat and tosses Raya aboard
	- Raya flails around, confirming that she's touching land again
	- Sisu swims back towards Tuk-tuk
	- Back on the boat, a shadow is cast over Raya
	- Raya, soaking wet, looks up:

#### Establishing Boun and the Boat

> **SHRIMPORIUM SHIP, LAKE, TAIL**

- There's a Tail kid, 15 years old-ish. Frying wok in one hand, spatula in another.
- "Welcome to the Kumandra-famous Shrimp-orium! My name is Boun, I’ll be your server today! Shrimp--"
	- Raya, still coughing out water, "Where's the captain?"
	- "I am the captain! Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. There's shrimp barbecued shrimp congee, boiled shrimp congee, broiled shrimp congee…"
- As Boun yaps on, Raya looks over her shoulder: Namaari's Fang squad has already made their way towards the coast. There's a boardwalk that extends a short while, and the Serlots just have to hop across a few ships to get to the Shrimporium. T-2 minutes.
	- Raya, finally getting her breath, speaks over him: "Can you just drive the boat out a little bit -- but not too far out!"
	- Boun: "Oh, I see, you want the dining-at-sea Tail experience. It'll cost you extra!"
	- Raya glances around for people at the other ships.
	- Boun: "Sorry, until sunset, I'm the only sailor in this lake who can serve you!"
	- "What, why?!"
	- Boun, hesitant to elaborate,"…because today is Midsummer (Sumer Solstice) during the fourth leap year? And the men don't drive their boats out or do any work, because they must spend time with their family today? -- And I'm not sixteen yet."
	- "Oh…"
- Boun double-takes. "Wait, you don't know. You're not from Tail. Sorry, I can't serve you."
	- Raya: "Nono, I am Tail! Yes, I'd like the out-on-the-ocean experience."
	- Boun: "Momma always said --"
- VOOSH! A big splash of water, and the boat tilts as Tuk-tuk climbs aboard.
	- Boun: "WHA-WHAT IS THAT! Please, don't hurt me!"
	- Raya: "Don't freak out! That's my pet mount, Tuk-tuk, he's a Pandolin. He's friendly."
- Tuk-tuk uses his mouth to pull a human hand out of the water -- it's Sisu.
	- Sisu: "Hiya! The water is *so* refreshing on a Midsummer noon --"
	- Boun: "Are you Tail?"
	- Raya tries to mouth-signal to Sisu…
	- Sisu spins around and checks her bum, thinking she hasn't shifted back properly, "Ah! I still have it on me! Ah. No tail. Just a normal-shaped human *punggung*."
- Boun: "Please, I can't serve you if you're not Tail."
	- Sisu: "We have gifts! Raya, you said you have lemongrass?"
	- Boun hops over, changed, "Lemongrass?! No way! I thought they were extinct!"
	- Namaari's Serlot starts racing down the boardwalk towards them
	- Raya shoves a fistful into Boun's hands. "Drive!"
- Boun stashes the lemongrass in a basket and hops into the driver's seat, and launches the boat full-throttle
	- it's not fast, but it's enough
	- the Serlots start jumping onto ships to close the gap
	- but the gang narrowly make their escape

#### Fang Resolution

> **DOCKS, LAKE, TAIL**

- One of the Fang soldiers notes that
	1. Raya can now escape anywhere, they won't keep up with the boat
	2. they'll likely go to Talon next for the next Gem piece
- Namaari says they're not following;
	- Talon is strong and dangerous territory, we'll intercept after
	- She chooses one of her elite soldiers to follow and spy on Raya #payme
		- not to interfere. Just collect info
	- She chooses a few more soldiers to warn the other tribe chiefs
		- "But they won't listen to us, we're Fang"
		- "They will, against a common enemy."
	- Namaari needs to head back to Fang to talk with her mother, Chief Virana
		- she needs to know what Raya is really trying to do
		- (Namaari doesn't actually understand the scroll she showed when she was younger)

> **FADE TO:**

### Settling into the Shrimporium

#### Raya's trauma

> **SHRIMPORIUM SHIP, LAKE, TAIL**

- Raya looks out: Namaari's squad retreats behind a mountain
- Raya peeks at Boun: his hands works fast with a chopping knife, slicing up the prawns and vegetables quite expertly
- Raya peers over the boat. She bites her lip in discomfort, and scurries back.
	- Sisu notices this: "Heya. What was that back there?"
	- They whisper out of earshot of Boun.
	- Raya deflects. "Yea. You didn't listen to me, I said not to go into the water. We'll dock as soon as possible and continue to Talon on Tuk-tuk."
	- "Those cat things can out-speed Tuk-tuk. If I had control of my full dragon power, I could fly us wherever, but a boat is still faster for long-distance travel!"
		- Tuk-tuk lounges lazily, exhausted from the previous chase
		- Sisu: "Besides, we're also safer from the Druun on the water."
	- Raya: "I never learnt how to drive a boat, and we can't be completely sure we can trust Boun, or any other sailor."
	- Sisu: "You've tracked down every river's end in Kumandra, but you never learnt how to sail? Kumandra isn't that big. If you learnt how to sail, you would've taken much less than 4 years."
		- Raya, "You got me, I never learnt how to swim."
	- Sisu: "Then why didn't you start? And come to think of it, if you assembled people to spread out, finding all the river's ends would've taken less than a year!"
		- Raya: "You can't trust anyone!"
	- Sisu: "If you want the tribes to trust each other to unite under One Kumandra, you need to start by trusting me."
- Raya sighs, downcast.
	- with voiced-over'ed FLASHBACKS:
	- "When my dad threw me into the water, to save me, the last thing I saw was him turning to stone. I wanted to cry, scream, wail. But how could I, when the river was drowning me?"
		- We see young Raya spasming in the water like adult Raya previously
			- never dying, never living
		- the river goes on for a long while…
	- "So whenever I fall into deep waters, my body does this *thing*…"
		- NEXT FLASHBACK: Raya, a bit older now, trying to jump across the river, but falls in. She spasms again.
- Back to present: "Every time, I'm reminded how my dad should've never given his trust to the other tribes."
- Sisu: "I'm sorry I pushed us in. But Boun, he's just a kid, he's not the Namaari who hurt you all those years ago. Namaari now isn't the same Namaari who hurt you all those years ago either. It seems a little unfair to automatically assume the worst."
- Raya swings her head around, deliberating. "I've been unfair to Boun, but Namaari is a different story."

#### Late Lunch

- "Food's ready!" calls Boun
	- Raya sits up and goes over to Boun.
	- "And now, for the legendary garnish!"
		- "Wait!!"
	- Raya swaps out the herbs in Boun's basket (which are actually padapepper) with a whole head of actual lemongrass from her satchel
	- Boun: "The colour's different."
		- Raya covers up: "These ones are fresher, they just grow like that."
		- Boun takes the actual lemongrass, expertly slices them up, and distributes it into the congee
		- "It's about the theatrics, the customers love the theatrics!"
	- Boun takes a test scoop — he dramatically falls to his knees in awe
		- "WOW, I never thought shrimp congee could get any better."
- Boun serves up a bowl for Raya first
	- Boun notices that Raya's apprehensive
		- "You haven't even tasted it yet"
		- "Oh, it's just that. I've lived on my own dried jackfruit for the past 15 years of my life… Not to say you've poisoned my food! Haha! You wouldn't poison my food! I wouldn't poison your food! Hahahahaha….."
		- Sisu: "Quit being weird and eat the congee."
		- Raya: "…all I'm saying is that you never know! You know!"
	- Sisu forces a spoonful of congee in her mouth
		- Raya protests at first, but then she surrenders, groaning at how good it is, just like Young Namaari in Episode 1 tasting the full stew
		- Raya mumbles: "I haven't tasted food like this in 15 years…"
			- this calls back to young Namaari, saying she's rarely eaten rice
	- Boun serves up the rest
- Sisu: "Hey, Boun, I was wondering. If it's ok with you, we'd like to sail with you to Talon."
	- "Talon! Another tribe. They're not very far, but wow… I've never left Tail all my life."
	- Raya: "If not, just drop us off at the next stop, we'll just continue on Tuk-tuk --"
	- "Alright, I'll take you to Talon! They'll have a lot of ingredients to level up my game!"
- Boun: "But first I'll need to make a quick stop on the way. There's something I need to do."
	- "What is it?"
	- "Oh. Just family matters. Midsummer things. Anyways, shrimp is….."
	- Raya squints suspiciously.

#### Namaari interlude

> **DRAGON GRAVEYARD, WILDERNESS - DUSK**

- Namaari and her soldiers pass through the field.
	- Petrified dragons lay in heroic poses, but look merely hand-sculpted
- Namaari solemnly (genuinely?) pays her respects, more so than the others

#### The Visit

> **SHRIMPORIUM SHIP, SWAMP, TAIL OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT**

- Raya paces around. "What if he's arranging an assault with his village?"
	- Sisu: "Boun has been gone for 5 minutes. You must have *damar*. He didn't poison our porridge like you were so worried about."
- Raya: "But what if that's his trick?"
	- Sisu: "What if, what if. What about *what is*?"
- Raya: "What *is* the reason why he made us stay on his ship?"
	- Sisu kicks back on a couch. "Comfort?"
	- "I could steal his boat! But he knows I can't drive a ship!"
	- "He *trusts* you that you wouldn't."
- Raya shakes her head and jumps out of the boat onto land. She sighs at the safety of solid ground.
	- "Raya, no!"
- Raya wades to shore in the ankle-height muddy waters.
	- She sees Boun's footprints in the mud. She follows it.

> **SWAMP, TAIL OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT**

- Raya picks up her pace, 

- Boun visiting petrified family
- Raya realises she made a mistake
- They return to the boat, Druun damaged the boat. they must find repairs at Talon
- Raya replaces padapepper with lemongrass?

%%
#### What are Druun?

- Raya as she stares at the purple glow and movement of druun ominously sweep through the mangrove trees on the shoreline.
- Boun: You know, during the day, you can almost forget they’re here, but at night… (clearly unnerved) This is why I never leave the boat.
- Boun: What are Druun?
- Sisu: A plague born from human discord, they’ve always been here - waiting for a moment of weakness to attack. They’re like the opposite of dragons, instead of bringing water and life to the world, they’re like a relentless fire that consumes everything in its wake until there’s nothing left except ash and stone.
- Boun: They took my family.
	- Sisu: They took mine too.
	- Two of them stare off into the distance on the back of the boat
- Raya looks on. But she doesn't join them.
