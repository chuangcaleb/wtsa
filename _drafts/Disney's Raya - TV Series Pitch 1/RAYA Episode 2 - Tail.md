# RAYA Episode 2 - Tail

## Episode 2 - Tail

### Sisu

- Raya and Tuk-Tuk follow a river, which has now gone down to a small trickle. It flows into an old wrecked ship, surrounded by old whale bones, trash, etc.
- She enters inside the shipwreck
- She repeats the ritual.
	- "Sisudatu… I don’t know if you’re listening. I’ve searched every river to find you. And now I’m here at the very last one. I trusted too much, and I broke the world… Sisudatu, I just really… really want my *ba* back. Please."
- Magic happens, Sisu appears! 
- Raya catches Sisu up on the events of the past 15 years…
	- "Oh, oh, oh my. Oh, this is bad. This is bad. I’ve been asleep for 500 years, you brought back the Druun, and none of my brothers and sisters came back? Why didn’t they come back?"
- Let's skip the part about unique individual dragon magic. It's meh and doesn't really add much.
- Sisu explains, they can still reassemble the Gem, destroy the Druun, and bring everyone back.

### Naamari pinch

- On a hilltop, Naamari inspects the footprints of Tuk-tuk. Four Fang soldiers on their own Serlots flank her.
- One of them point out that 
	- Tail is infested with Druun, Raya's good as stone
	- Retrieving the scroll isn't worth the risk
- Namaari turns to him, sharply spitting, "Go back home." The soldiers look amongst themselves."Or, you can follow me and make things right for Fang."
- Namaari pushes her mount onwards, leaving the rest of them to continue on.

### Tail Temple

- Raya and Sisu encounter a limestone temple on the top of a hill.
- Raya explains: each piece was claimed by each of the chiefs of the five lands.
	- We get a splitscreen, showing each tribe chief holding a weapon that has been embedded with their Gem piece.
- Sisu questions why she is dressed like a human. 
	- Raya says they have to disguise so they don't attract attention.
	- Sisu rebuffs, "But don't people love us, after all we've done for them? Won't the tribes finally unite if they see me?"
	- Raya replies, "The other tribes all have bad people, like Namaari. Trust me."
- They work through the temple; and avoid traps.
	- Sisu is confused. "These traps wouldn't stop Druun."
	- Raya replies, "They're to stop people."
- Sisu exclaims they should have brought a welcome gift!
- We skip the awkward dialogue about Sisu being "good at swimming".
- They enter the temple core, and see the dead Tail chieftess.
	- "Oof," remarks Sisu, "that's what happens when you hold on too tight."
	- They retrieve Tail's Gem weapon artefact: either a [kujang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kujang_(weapon)) or a [celurit/sabit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celurit). 
- Sisu touches the stone, and turns into a human version of herself.
	- "Whoa, what did you do? Can you undo it?"
	- "I don't know, it just happened! Now that you don't have to disguise me, the rest should be easy!"
	- "This one was easy, but the rest of them are being held by a bunch of no-good binturis."

### Fang Ambush

- "I'm sorry I made you feel that way."
	- Raya turns around; it's Namaari, alone.
	- Raya grits, "Naamari."
	- "Oh!" Sisu exclaims, "You're the one who backstabbed Raya fifteen years ago!"
- "I'm sorry, Raya. I was a kid, just wanting to please my mother."
	- "Oh, please. You make the worst rumours we heard about Fang sound like children's fables. You caused the world… to come to this! You took away my father."
- "I… did wrong. And I wanted to make things right. So I started to track down the rivers to find Sisu, according to the Scroll… then two years ago, the scroll was stolen from my possession by a girl with her Pandalin pet. So I've been trying to find you, so we can do this quest together."
	- "Fang is the last tribe I'd join with, and you're the last person from Fang I'd trust."
- Raya continues, "Besides, I've already found Sisu."
	- Sisu waves. "Sisu, that's me! Raya, I think we can work with her! Then we can get the Gem artefact from Fang, then that's just two more to go!"
- Namaari, "Raya… I don't know who is this crazy person you've convinced to be Sisu… but she's right. You need all five Gem pieces, how do you expect to save Kumandra if you only have four? Unless…"
	- "Don't worry about the gem pieces, Namaari. Worry about the landslide."
	- "What landsli-"
- Raya triggers a trap, causing some loose rocks to fall onto Namaari. The temple collapses.
	- Namaari's caught in it and needs to retreat.
	- Raya grabs Sisu by the hand. "Run!"
- Raya and Sisu mount on Tuk-tuk, and pull away
	- the four Fang soldiers launch in hot pursuit of Raya on their Serlots
	- "See, Sisu!" Raya shouts, "Namaari had backup! We can't trust Fang!"

### Fang Escape

- Raya exclaims, they need to escape to the water!
- Namaari joins the ranks of her soldiers on her own Serlot
- Let's extend this huge chase sequence by adding some more mythical elements!
	- Perhaps some Druun pop up.
