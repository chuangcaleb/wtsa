# RAYA Episode 2 - Tail

## Episode 2 - Tail

### Setup Sisu and Namaari

#### Introduce Sisu

> **SHIPWRECK CAVERN, TAIL - DAY (PRESENT)**

- Raya and Tuk-Tuk follow a river, which has now gone down to a small trickle. It flows into an old wrecked ship, surrounded by old whale bones, trash, etc.
- She enters inside the shipwreck
- She repeats the ritual.
	- "Sisudatu… I don’t know if you’re listening. I’ve searched every river to find you. And now I’m here at the very last one. I trusted too much, and I broke the world… Sisudatu, I just really… really want my *ba* back. Please."
- Magic happens, Sisu appears!
- Raya catches Sisu up on the events of the past 15 years…
	- "Oh, oh, oh my. Oh, this is bad. This is bad. I’ve been asleep for 500 years, you brought back the Druun, and none of my brothers and sisters came back? Why didn’t they come back?"
- Let's skip the part about unique individual dragon magic. It's meh and doesn't really add much.
- Sisu explains, they can still reassemble the Gem, destroy the Druun, and bring everyone back.

#### Naamari pinch

> **HILLTOP, TAIL**

- On a hilltop, Naamari inspects the footprints of Tuk-tuk. Four Fang soldiers on their own Serlots flank her.
- One of them point out that
	- Tail is infested with Druun, Raya's good as stone
	- Retrieving the scroll isn't worth the risk
- Namaari turns to him, sharply spitting, "Go back home." The soldiers look amongst themselves."Or, you can follow me and make things right for Fang."
	- (ooo ambiguous)
- Namaari pushes her mount onwards, leaving the rest of them to continue on.

### Getting the Tail gem

#### Tail Temple

> **TEMPLE, TAIL**

- Raya and Sisu encounter a limestone temple in a cave of a cliff
- Raya explains: each piece was claimed by each of the chiefs of the five lands.
	- We get a splitscreen, showing each tribe chief holding a weapon that has been embedded with their Gem piece.
		- Heart's Gem is embedded into Chief Benja's whip-sword
		- Fang's Gem is embedded into Chief Virana's scepter-[trishula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trishula)
		- Talon's Gem is embedded into Chief Dang Hai's karambit
		- Spine's Gem in a bamboo spear
		- Tail's Gem in a [kujang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kujang_(weapon))
- Sisu questions why she is dressed like a human.
	- Raya says they have to disguise so they don't attract attention.
	- Sisu rebuffs, "But don't people love us, after all we've done for them? Won't the tribes finally unite if they see me?"
	- Raya replies, "The other tribes all have bad people, like Namaari. Trust me."
- They work through the temple; and avoid traps.
	- Sisu, "Wow, you're real good at this."
	- Raya: "Yea, my dad trained me for this with our own version at home."
	- Sisu is confused. "These traps wouldn't stop Druun."
	- Raya replies, "They're to stop people."
	- Raya also remarks that people from Tail are naturally good navigators/infiltrators, so these traps are totally in-character
- They encounter a room that would be impossible for normal people
	- this is why no one has ever stolen the unguarded Tail Gem artefact
	- Perhaps they have to squeeze through some narrow doorway into a room with a very high ceiling and slippery walls. It's impossible to bring ladders or scaffolds of some kind — there would be leftover structures in the room to show that it had been attempted before
		- Sisu is able to scale up the wall with Raya on her back
- Sisu exclaims they should have brought a welcome gift!
- We skip the awkward setup dialogue about Sisu being "good at swimming".

> **THRONE ROOM, TEMPLE, TAIL**

- They enter the temple throne room, and see the dead Tail chieftess.
	- "Oof," remarks Sisu, "that's what happens when you hold on too tight."
	- They retrieve Tail's Gem weapon artefact: either a [kujang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kujang_(weapon)) or a [celurit/sabit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celurit).
- Sisu touches the stone, and turns into a human version of herself.
	- "Whoa, what did you do? Can you undo it?"
	- "I don't know, it just happened! Now that you don't have to disguise me, the rest should be easy!"
	- "This one was easy, but the rest of them are being held by a bunch of no-good binturis."

#### Fang Ambush

- "I'm sorry I made you feel that way."
	- Raya turns around; it's Namaari, alone, on a landing a stone's throw away.
	- Raya grits, "Naamari."
	- "Oh!" Sisu exclaims, "You're the one who backstabbed Raya fifteen years ago!"
- "I'm sorry, Raya. I was a kid, just wanting to please my mother."
	- "Oh, please. You make the worst rumours we heard about Fang sound like children's fables. You caused the world… to come to this! You took away my father."
- "I… did a wrong thing. And I wanted to make things right. So I started to track down the rivers to find Sisu, according to the Scroll… then two years ago, the scroll was stolen from my possession by a girl with her Pandalin pet. So I've been trying to find you, so we can do this quest together."
	- "Fang is the last tribe I'd join with, and you're the last person from Fang I'd trust."
- Raya continues, "Besides, I've already found Sisu."
	- Sisu waves. "That's me, Sisu! Raya, I think we can work with her! Then we can get the Gem artefact from Fang, then that's just two more to go!"
- Namaari: "Raya… I don't know who is this crazy person you've convinced to be Sisu… but she's right. You need all five Gem pieces, how do you expect to save Kumandra if you only have four? Unless…"
	- "Don't worry about the gem pieces, Namaari. Worry about the landslide."
	- "What landsli-"
- Raya triggers a bobby trap, causing some loose rocks to fall onto Namaari. The temple collapses.
	- Namaari's caught in it and needs to retreat.
	- Raya grabs Sisu by the hand. "Run!"

> **TEMPLE, TAIL**

- Raya and Sisu mount on Tuk-tuk, and pull away
	- the four Fang soldiers outside launch in hot pursuit of Raya on their Serlots
	- "See, Sisu!" Raya shouts, "Namaari had backup! We can't trust Fang!"

#### Fang Escape Sequence

> **TAIL LANDSCAPE**

- Namaari joins the ranks of her soldiers on her own Serlot
- Let's extend this huge chase sequence by adding some more mythical elements!
	- Perhaps some Druun pop up. Namaari is delayed as she stops her chase to defend her people. She can actually take on at least one Druun herself with normal weapons.
- Sisu exclaims, "The Druun and the Serlot mounts (large hybrid cats) are both afraid of water!"
	- Raya rejects the idea, "No, we need another way."
	- But as Namaari gains distance, close enough to touch them…
	- Sisu pulls the reigns on Tuk-tuk, veering him sideways and hard launching them (Tuk-tuk, Sisu, and Raya) a good distance off and into the the water below
	- The Serlots halt completely, refusing to go into the water

> **LAKE, TAIL**

- SPLASH!
- PANIC. Raya is flailing all about. She takes in gulps of water
	- Flashbacks of when her dad pushed her off the bridge
- Sisu is excited to be in the water! She swims about in her dragon form.
- Sisu then notices Raya struggling. She fetches her and drags her upright
	- No one sees Sisu's dragon form
	- Tuk-tuk doggy paddles just fine!
- Now that Raya is calmer, we see that the lake is a dock for a dozen fishing ships, mostly unoccupied
- Sisu swims over to the nearest boat and tosses Raya aboard
	- Raya sighs in relief to be touching land again
	- A shadow is cast over her
	- Raya, soaking wet, looks up:

#### Boun and the Boat

- There's a Tail kid, 15 years old-ish. Frying wok in one hand, spatula in another.
	- "Welcome to the world famous Shrimp-orium. My name is Boun, I’ll be your server today."
	- Raya, coughing out water, "Where's the captain"
	- "I am the captain, now --"
- Boun: "Wait, you're not from Tail. Sorry, I can't serve you. #todo"

setting up the ship before them like a professional one-man restaurant. "Welcome to the world famous Shrimp-orium. My name is Boun, I’ll be your server today."

	- Boun protests that he's not running a water-taxi, but exclaims in agreement when he sees Raya dump out blocks of jade (their currency)

- Boun drives the boat — but it's at a snail's crawl. "It takes some time to rev up!"
	- Sisu trips overboard — in the water, she has control over her shapeshifting between human/dragon forms.
	- She starts to peddle the boat until it picks up a steady speed
	- Boun: "Hey, this boat is already moving! Cool!"
- the Serlots start jumping onto ships to close the gap, but the gang already make their escape.
- A Fang officer notes that they'll likely go to Talon next;
	- Namaari says they're not following; they need to head back to Fang to talk with her mother, Chief Virana.

### Getting to know Boun

#### Boun wouldn't poison you

- The shrimp boat flows down a swamp river
- Sisu enjoys the swim
	- Raya reprimands her — people could notice her
	- "Sisu, I saw people lose their minds over a dragon gem. Can you imagine what they’d do over an actual dragon? Look, we need you to make this all work."
	- "Until we have all the gems, you have to stay human. Please."
	- Sisu turns back human reluctantly
- Boun announces, "Who's hungry?" He whips out fresh bowls of porridge.
	- Raya declines. She whispers to Sisu, "It could be poisoned!"
	- (The last person, the Tail nomad from Episode 1, did actually poison her food)
	- Boun shrugs, slurps his own congee down, "If it were, you'll die happy!"
	- Raya opens her own supply of cold, dried jackfruit, and struggles chewing it.
	- Sisu is enjoying her porridge

#### Namaari interlude

- Namaari and her soldiers pass through a graveyard of petrified dragons.
- Namaari solemnly pays her respects, more so than the others

#### What are Druun?

- Raya as she stares at the purple glow and movement of druun ominously sweep through the mangrove trees on the shoreline.
- Boun: You know, during the day, you can almost forget they’re here, but at night… (clearly unnerved) This is why I never leave the boat.
- Boun: What are Druun?
- Sisu: A plague born from human discord, they’ve always been here - waiting for a moment of weakness to attack. They’re like the opposite of dragons, instead of bringing water and life to the world, they’re like a relentless fire that consumes everything in its wake until there’s nothing left except ash and stone.
- Boun: They took my family.
	- Sisu: They took mine too.
	- Two of them stare off into the distance on the back of the boat
- Raya looks on. But she doesn't join them.
