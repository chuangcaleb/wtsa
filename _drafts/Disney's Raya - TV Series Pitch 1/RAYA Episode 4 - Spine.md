# RAYA Episode 4 - Spine

## Ideas

- "The gem isn't a weapon!" Well now it really is made into weapons, and actually helps against Druun.
- Spine does need their super-staff to survive, and are willing to give it up on Sisu's authenticity
- some
- [Jianzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jianzi) / đá cầu / sipa / capteh
	- except it's like combat juggling
	- each team has to keep "alive" their dacau, whilst trying to take down the other teams'
	- maybe they have three each, and can use them to hit others out of the air
		- the lighter women are launched into the air to spike opponents' balls out
	- soft combat is allowed!
	- there's a 2m deep pond in the center of the arena
		- Spine players abuse Raya not willing to cross into the pond
		- Raya must admit her fear of water,
			- or maybe be willing to stand underwater to boost her shorter teammates like Noi to land a spike
	- Namaari brings chilis from Fang to help with the cold
- lol one of those doors with an eye slider, where you have to answer a prompt with the correct passphrase
- they don't believe in dragons lol
- Raya's the avatar of the worst traits of the five nations lol
	- Tail: generally untrusting
	- Talon: false deception
	- Spine: indifferent independence
	- Heart: champion conspiring
	- Fang: ruthless, internal trust
- they find a water redirection
