# RAYA E3 - Talon

## Ideas

- switcheroo fake artefacts, how to trust the real one?
- Boun and Sisu on the hunt for a ship component fix part, that broke by the Druun because Raya doubted Boun was going offshore to memoralize parents
- dragon-fruit
- Heart refugees undercover in Talon
	- Raya is excited to meet her own people, trusting them!
	- but they betray her — you can’t even trust your own

This one goes mostly the same as the original story. So I'll just hit off the main plot points.

## Enter Talon

> **EXT. DOCKS, TALON - NIGHT**

- Raya enters Talon, the floating marketplace rife with commerce and infamous for thievery.
	- She disallows Sisu nor Boun from coming along.
- She encounters a lone child (who we’ll refer to as “Noi”), and offers help
	- the toddler turns out to be a con-artist-baby, who steals her satchel with the help of three ongi-monkeys
	- I’m thinking of making
	- Raya loses her satchel containing the Gem artefacts
- Raya eventually tracks them down, and retrieves her satchel
	- but seeing the toddler and the monkeys downcast, Raya enlists their help to infiltrate the Talon palace
- Meanwhile, Sisu goes to the market. She has no coins, nothing to lose.
	- Sisu accidentally stirs up trouble with some locals
	- An old local lady comes to her defence
	- She also offers to take her to the Talon chief
