# One Small Change

 From downright terrible un-salvageable stories, to spectacular stories that are already practically perfect... sometimes it just takes *one small change* to elevate a story to the highest level.

## Nando v Movies

A Youtuber [Nando v Movies](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf29Sq6-XxLQG_XuJwMHaFg) has a video essay series called **"One Small Change"** where he takes one scene, and from there one small plot beat or character dialogue exchange, and then slightly nudges it ever so slightly â€” this in turn causes the entire story to be recontextualized in a completely brand-new light.

It is one thing to criticize and judge a story. Everybody has an opinion. But to be more objective and to back up your opinions, you will need/get to go a step higher/further to suggest and present the change.

That's what I've applied with my [[Film Reviews]]: while I can whine all I want about whatever being bad, I always phrase it as **"Things I'd Tweak"**, and the alternative-universe stories that I unearth and discover become an adventure of their own.

## On Rewriting

Now of course, there are many reasons why a good story may go sideways during production. Doing rewrites, we always have:

1. **The benefit of hindsight.** Especially after seeing a final product on the big screen, because it's harder to catch midway.
2. **The benefit of freedom:** Studio executives have their own agenda (which may be good or bad), but they frequently bump shoulders with storywriting.

And the small change should be contained within a scene, even as far as changing one word in dialogue. Any bigger wouldn't count as one small change ;) 

But that word can flip the entire story upside down. You'd be surprised at how large a difference can result from one small change.
