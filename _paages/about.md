## What's whatsthestoryabout about?

Hello thereâ€”my name is Caleb!

I'm a final-year student procrastinating his dissertation for his Computer Science with AI degree. I've published a few random coding projects [here](https://github.com/chuangcaleb) and [there](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/calebchan/).

## I also really, really love **story**.

Story: books, movies, songs, theatre, musicals. _Narratives_.

Not so much the [writing style](https://helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/a-writer-or-a-storyteller/), like grammar, word choice, descriptive language, etc. Though the skill of _conveying information through a medium **efficiently** and **artfully**_ may be part-and-parcel of **story**.

No, I'm more specifically talking about the age-old practice of **storytelling**: _finding **universal truths** of human experience and translating them into **cohesive drama**_.

I believe stories have such a resonant effect on people: they have shaped lives and defined societies. Human history itself is a story being written and told. Story runs in our veins, whether we like it or not, and everything _is_ story.

And after years of searching for my own place, I've finally found something I'm not too bad at: intuitively understanding the interconnected web of story. It's going to change so many lives.

## Story on paper

People know this about me: after a really interesting movie, I _have_ to discuss the movie with someone. There's so much to evaluate and critique and digest. I needed somewhere to dump my thoughts.

I tried running [an Instagram account](https://instagram.com/whatsthestoryabout) for a while (a good while!), but I ended up taking more time designing than actually writing out things.

Through my Computer Science degree, I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and learnt about the amazing [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) format (a common language in the coding field!). Then I thought, why not integrate [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) with my writing escapades? I learnt and practiced even more to be able to maintain a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site.

Which brings us here. So this website-blog-space-area is my external dump of all the thoughts in my head. Nothing too fancy, no special theme styling, just focus on getting everything out of my head, and onto this digital paper.

Welcome to the dump.
