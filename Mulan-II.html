<blockquote>
  <p>The flower that blooms in unity is the most honourable one of them all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>So I‚Äôll be giving my thoughts on this movie <strong>from a pure story perspective</strong>: excluding Mushu being voiced by a white guy + the low budget animation (well, besides the grieving scene in the rain; but everywhere else, sheesh) + historical/cultural (in)accuracies.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a cheap direct-to-video cashgrab,‚Äù UGH profits. But from a story POV, why should we lower the bar for sequels? (Especially when Kung Fu Panda 2 exists).</p>

<p>Of course, we must compare it with the first movie. There weren‚Äôt really any iconic plot beats. Reflection. Cutting her hair, slipping away in the rain. Climbing the pole. The decimated village. Ugh, Mulan I is so good. Not perfect, but great and iconic.</p>

<p>I think while it set some good groundwork, and was a fun ride, a lot was still lacking narrative-wise, especially in the intellectual thematic argument, which has so much to say.</p>

<h2 id="plot-summary">Plot Summary</h2>

<p>(since y‚Äôall probably never watched it, some never will, here it is)</p>

<h3 id="prose">Prose</h3>

<p>Shang proposes to Mulan. Mushu would lose his status as family guardian, as well as Mulan, so decides to break them up. The Emperor summons the duo to escort his three princess daughters to form an alliance with Lord Qin to protect them from a coming Mongol invasion. They recruit the Gang of Three (Yao, Ling and Chien-Po) from the first movie.</p>

<p>En route, the three princesses fall in love with the Gang of Three. Mushu causes trouble for Mulan‚Äôs r‚Äôship, accidentally destroying their carriage/supplies. The guards and princesses sneak out and enjoy a festival at a village, while Mushu orchestrates Mulan and Shang into a heated argument.</p>

<p>Shang puts his foot down, forbidding the three pairs to talk, then mutually breaks up with Mulan. They get attacked by bandits and Shang sacrifices himself for Mulan.</p>

<p>Mulan grieves, then offers herself as bride instead of the princesses. Shang returns to crash the marriage. Mushu masquerades as the Great Dragon to dissuade Lord Qin, and weds the duo on the spot.</p>

<h3 id="plot-structure">Plot Structure</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Hook</strong>: Mulan trains some girls, and Shang comes to propose to her.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Inciting Incident</strong>: The Emperor summons the Mulan and Shang to the palace for a secret mission. Mushu finds out he would lose his status as family guardian, as well as Mulan, should they get married.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Key Event</strong>: The duo decide to call off their wedding, and head to the palace. The Emperor quests them to escort his three princess daughters to form an alliance with Lord Qin to protect them from a coming Mongol invasion.</li>
  <li>
<strong>First Plot Point</strong>: They leave their kingdom with the three princesses and three guards.</li>
  <li>
<strong>First Pinch Point</strong>: Mushu sabotages the carriage, destroying it. They must stop and set up camp.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Midpoint</strong>: The oldest princess, Ting-Ting, asserts to her sisters that they must follow their duty over their heart. Nevertheless, they sneak out with the guards to attend a festival.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Second Pinch Point</strong>: Shang catches them in the village, puts his foot down, and forbids their blossoming relationships. Mulan is incredulous and they break their own relationship off.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Third Plot Point</strong>: They get ambushed by the Mongols, resulting in Shang falling to his death. They regroup and mourn. Mulan decides to offer herself in the princesses‚Äô place.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Climactic Turning Point</strong>: Shang crashes the wedding, alive apparently. They don‚Äôt like him.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Climactic Buildup</strong>: Mushu masquerades as the Great Dragon to dissuade Lord Qin.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Climactic Moment</strong>: Lord Qin gives in, and weds the duo on the spot.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Resolution</strong>: China is saved, due to the alliance. Mushu is added onto Shang‚Äôs family guardians, which means he still gets to be with Mulan.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-to-improve">What to improve</h2>

<h3 id="1-white-mushu">1. White Mushu</h3>

<p>Yea, discount Eddie Murphy was a hot mess. <strong>MulanII!Mushu was neither charismatic nor had his character explored enough</strong> to justify being conniving yet justify the audience‚Äôs sympathy, so he‚Äôs e just a bad bad guy. He‚Äôs just a plot device, it seems.</p>

<p>AND THEN when Mushu confesses what he‚Äôs done, and Mulan exclaims that Shang and her aren‚Äôt that different (this goes against <em>Lesson Number One</em>‚Äôs main message that differences are good). She then says all those problems weren‚Äôt because of themselves, but only because of Mushu (rip representation of a realistic couple working out their own flaws and differences, nope, if not for external forces, internally they are perfect, bro).</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Instead, we make</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mushu's arc a subplot about learning that there are circumstances where you must put duty over heart.</code></strong> WHAT?! Yes. One is not enough, we need both together. Mulan I was able to juggle advocating for the opposing themes of femininity vs masculinity.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What if</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mushu learns that if Mulan gets married, he won‚Äôt just lose guardianship; she‚Äôll physically never see him again.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">He must wrestle to make the honourable choice to put his duty as guardian to Mulan‚Äôs happiness over his heart to be with her. He could be tempted to meddle with the couple once or twice, but it only causes some small trouble that by itself shouldn‚Äôt start a spark; but the couple escalates it on their own. And later, when Mushu confesses, Mulan recognises it‚Äôs their own fault.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">We could also make a bigger deal of Mushu being the one to wed them, because he‚Äôs effectively done his duty but lost his friend. If you want a gut punch, Mushu is consequently invisible to Mulan forever. Mulan shows her gratitude for the best guardian ever.</code></p>

<h3 id="2-emperors-army">2. Emperor‚Äôs Army</h3>

<p><strong>The Emperor doesn‚Äôt want to send his daughters, so why not just let his army fight instead?</strong> He was so wise in the first one‚Ä¶ and looks like the fool now. ‚Äútrust me, bro‚Äù. Apparently Mongols are not from this era irl, so <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let‚Äôs simply say the last remnants of the Huns are overrunning towns.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Our kingdom‚Äôs males-of-age have been too diminished from Shan Yu‚Äôs campaign from the last movie, and the Emperor didn‚Äôt want the couple worrying after their great victory. But now he‚Äôs desperate, desperate enough to send his own daughters.</code></p>

<h3 id="3-mulans-theme">3. Mulan‚Äôs theme</h3>

<p><strong>Mulan also suddenly goes off about arranged marriages</strong> when Mulan was literally preparing to be match-made in the first 5 minutes of Mulan I. Even had a song about it. It‚Äôs also literally the culture. But she needs to oppose this tradition, because we need to explain it to the audience, and she has to mentor the princesses. The first song shows Mulan understands that you must balance both heart and duty ‚Äî then why‚Äôs she so imbalanced towards heart?</p>

<p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mulan doesn‚Äôt need to be so polar opposite to duty.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The princesses can craft and imply their own ideas. Shang may be the argument for</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extreme duty</code></em>,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">but since we already have so many arguments for</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extreme heart</code></em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">; let Mulan represent</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perfect balance</code></em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">but only seem to side with</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">heart</code></em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">when arguing and contrasting against Shang‚Äôs</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extreme duty.</code></em></p>

<h3 id="4-deadline">4. Deadline</h3>

<p><strong>We don‚Äôt feel the pressure of the Mongols and the deadline.</strong> They literally get mentioned once vaguely at the start, and never hear of them again. We don‚Äôt have that decimated village suckerpunch from Mulan I. We don‚Äôt see the¬†<a href="https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/what-are-pinch-points-and-how-can-they-make-your-book-easier-to-write/" class="web-link">consequences</a> if they fail their mission, if they choose heart over duty. ‚ÄúDuty‚Äù doesn‚Äôt get to make a single case for itself, so it gets brutally whalloped by <em>Heart/Emotions</em>. Past the Midpoint when Princess Ting-Ting swaps sides, Shang is singled out and antagonised for sticking to honouring one‚Äôs duty, when that going-above-one‚Äôs-duty is a virtue that is praised in Mulan I.</p>

<p>The antagonists should appear earlier. Instead, we could have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hun spies catch wind of the marriage alliance. They send assassins to attack the gang at pinch points just when things get too lovey-dovey: the guards are punished for following their heart.</code></p>

<p>This would also make up for <strong>the boring lack of action set-pieces</strong>. It‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ political and interpersonal. Not that that‚Äôs bad, but how can you have a plot about delivering a royal escort, with only one coincidental attack by random bandits throughout the entire runtime?! We also don‚Äôt get to see Mulan‚Äôs iconic tactical ingenuity and thinking outside-of-the-box.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Let the Emperor send an entourage. Let the Huns attack, and they cause the carriage runaway sequence. The gang might, I don‚Äôt know, fly across a gorge, isolating them from the entourage for the rest of the journey. Next, Mulan and Shang could be arguing while doing some sparring practice, and someone gets accidentally hurt, physically and emotionally.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The surprise attack would be by a pack of elite soldiers, who know the legend Fa Mulan who downed Shan Yu and their entire army. We get moments of genius from Mulan, to the amazement of the princesses. Shang and Mulan awkwardly avoid each other because they just argued.</code></p>

<h3 id="5-clunky-dialogue">5. Clunky Dialogue</h3>

<p><strong>Clunky dialogue. It‚Äôs hit-or-miss.</strong> For every ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about his heart, it‚Äôs about mine,‚Äù there‚Äôs twenty ‚ÄúI have another duty‚Ä¶ to my heart!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn an ideal world, not everyone can marry for love! But the world isn‚Äôt perfect. I‚Äôm just glad my world is.‚Äù Wow Shang really just said ‚Äúrip to them but we‚Äôre different‚Äù AGHH <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I don‚Äôt know, just say ‚ÄúTheir case is different than ours; the entire kingdom depends on their marriage.‚Äù</code></p>

<p>While I liked that we got to see a couple resolving an everyday argument and saying sorry, I didn‚Äôt like how they‚Äôre suddenly both sexist?? ‚ÄúWhat is it with men and asking directions?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat is it with women and maps?‚Äù At least make it sexist according to Chinese culture lol. And, if they apologise for that, that means they should affirm these toxic stereotypes.</p>

<pre><code class="language-screenplay-edited">SHANG
My father raised me as a soldier since I was a boy. You should trust my expert experience.

MULAN
The map is too ruined. You should consider your fiance‚Äôs advice.
</code></pre>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shang can even say something terrible, but cultural, like, ‚ÄúDid they even teach you anything in those rural schools?‚Äù but later regrets and acknowledges that‚Äôs out of line.</code></p>

<h3 id="6-anticlimactic-climax">6. Anticlimactic climax</h3>

<p><strong>The climax flopped.</strong> Mushu saves the day in a deus ex machina, the cardinal sin. Why did the princesses/guards even need to be there for, besides showing face? Mulan just kinda stood there. Shang throws a Japanese shuriken. Here‚Äôs a quick rewrite: (hah)</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Quick cuts of Shang, the princesses/guards and Hun assassins sneaking into the palace, knocking out the local guards, so there‚Äôs no one else to the rescue. When Shang crashes the wedding, the Huns spring into action, scattering everyone. Mulan and her handmaidens are backed up into a corner, hopelessly outnumbered, when they reveal to be the soldier trio in makeup disguise! Shang and the princesses disguised as soldiers protect the princes, who show their true colours as spoiled brats in front of the princesses.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">More fighting; Mushu wants to light a signal fire for help. He only puffs a small flame, then the soldier trio fan it so hard that it almost dies. The princesses step in and fan it gently, growing into a huge fire. Support arrives, rounding up the rest of the Huns. Emperor Qin honours the alliance without needing marriage.</code></p>

<h3 id="7-the-clown-prince">7. The Clown Prince</h3>

<p>Why is the foreign crown prince portrayed so dumb; I thought we decided with the soldier trio that we shouldn‚Äôt shame weird people. lol. Then the dad/Emperor just forgets about the whole alliance thing and plays with the chinese finger trap. bruh??? No thoughts, head empty.</p>

<h3 id="8-resolution">8. Resolution</h3>

<p><strong>There was no plot resolution.</strong> What happened to the alliance/the invasion?<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Since the Huns would‚Äôve wiped all China, Mulan saved the Northern Kingdom too, but they did not reciprocate dutifully. Mulan could give some speech about dishonour, and the other Emperor would be ashamed, and agree to the alliance without the marriages.</code></p>

<p>What are the consequences of the princesses getting with lowly guards? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The guards could be sentenced to execution for treason (just like how in the first movie, Shang sentenced Mulan to death when he found out she was a woman), but the princesses step in gracefully, explaining their honour. They then offer to give up their royalty ties, and live as nobodies, but with their loves. yay</code></p>

<h2 id="what-i-liked">What I liked</h2>

<h3 id="1-princesses-as-main-characters">1. Princesses as main characters</h3>

<p>Giving <strong>the princesses</strong> some spotlight instead of Mulan. I like that it doesn‚Äôt try to force Mulan into a positive arc. Mulan <em>works</em> as a flat arc character, and it‚Äôs great to see her as a mentor to the princesses. We also see the flip side of the glamour of Disney princesses, and it ties well into Mulan‚Äôs themes: their responsibility to the kingdom. It‚Äôs not all glitter and princes: especially in Imperial China. It sets up a good conflict.</p>

<h3 id="2-songs">2. Songs</h3>

<p><strong>The two (2) songs bop.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Lesson Number One</em></strong> is Mulan teaching little girls that you can/should/must be strong AND gentle. It‚Äôs to the tune/style of honour to Us All with the training montage feel of Be A Man. All songs have lyrics about who ‚ÄúYou must be‚Ä¶‚Äù, and it finally comes to a climax in this song. Would‚Äôve been nice in the bridge, to see the girls trying to exaggerate being rough to imitate masculinity, but Mulan corrects them.</p>

<p><strong><em>Like Other Girls</em></strong> isn‚Äôt a song about them just wanting to run away with the guards; they want to escape the walls of their palace, a la Jasmine in Aladdin. It‚Äôs clear from the ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about his heart, it‚Äôs about mine,‚Äù line that this goes deeper than just another romance song. (Yes, the ‚ÄúLike holding a lily‚Äù part is low-key racist, t‚Äôwas a bad attempt at making a Western tone feel Chinese. Just keep it Western.)</p>

<h3 id="3-the-third-act-twist">3. The third act twist</h3>

<p>The third act twist: Mulan takes the princess‚Äô place in arranged marriage. <strong>It is a stark reflection of how Mulan took her father‚Äôs place in the conscription, but in reverse</strong>, not going to war as a man, but to marriage as a woman. Again, Mulan makes the heroic, honourable choice of sacrificing her life, but in a subversive way.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis is Fa Mulan, the hero who saved China! She is worth more than three princesses!‚Äù No matter how much Mulan excelled at being the stereotypical heroic male war hero, she was still treated just as a trophy wife.</p>

<p>Seems like just three points, but they are three very strong points.</p>

<hr>

<p>LOL so I watched a video where they talked about the cultural aspect of this movie. In the climax, Shang interrupts the wedding seal by throwing a <em>shuriken</em>. A Japanese shuriken. From a Chinese setting. hahahahahahahahha</p>

<h3 id="major-rewrite-changes">Major rewrite changes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Focus on the central theme of heart vs. duty</li>
  <li>Mushu‚Äôs weird selfish plot device instead becomes a thematic arc to learn duty</li>
  <li>Covering plot holes: reasons why the Emperor can‚Äôt just use his own army</li>
  <li>Mulan instead becomes the paragon: perfect union between heart and duty</li>
  <li>Antagonistic Huns attack the gang every time they put heart over duty</li>
  <li>Characteristic dialogue</li>
  <li>Climactic battle rewritten from scratch</li>
  <li>Resolution with consequences</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>(no label) - The scene has roughly the same purpose in the plot as the original.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CUT - The scene was entirely cut out. Useless.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NEW - The scene did not exist in the source material, and was concepted just for the rewrite.</code></li>

  <li>In a wild field, little girls come running wildly to Mulan wanting to learn how to fight and be like her.</li>
  <li>She sings Lesson Number One: You must be both tough AND gentle.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The oldest girl exaggerates being tough, imitating a man, and destroys her sparring partner. Mulan offers to spar with her, and by being fluid and gentle whilst firmly blocking some hits, defeats her without ever landing a hit herself. She‚Äôs learnt lesson number one.</code></li>
  <li>Shang arrives! Manly war general, come to confess his love. The girls giggle at the manly emotionalness and stutter.</li>

  <li>Mulan says yes.</li>

<h3 id="13-reacting-to-the-engagement">1.3 Reacting to the Engagement</h3>

<ul>
  <li>As Mulan dresses up in her room, she breaks the news to Mushu</li>
  <li>He establishes it‚Äôs been <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">two years</code> since Mulan I</li>
  <li>Mulan affirms that Mushu is her most trusted friend, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AND beyond dutiful as her guardian: Mushu has proven to be honourable.</code>
</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mulan explains how they had talked about it already and how Shang had planned it all in advance, and they are set to marry the next afternoon already.</code></li>
  <li>Shang enters. ‚ÄúYour Grandma invited someone to help us celebrate.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Close relatives.‚Äù</code>
</li>
  <li>Cousins fill the courtyard. They go out to greet them.</li>
  <li>Mushu wakes up the ancestors. He gloats at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">how much he went beyond his duty</code>, not just keeping Mulan safe, but also helping her find love.</li>
  <li>The ancestors remind him that <strong>once Mulan is married, Mushu <del>loses</del> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fulfils</code> his guardianship of Mulan. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">This means Mushu will go back to sleep as a stone guardian</code>.</strong>
</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">He realises. Bragging doesn‚Äôt matter anymore: he will lose Mulan.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The ancestors dare Mushu: how honourable are you, really? Will you keep to your duty to see the marriage through, even if it means losing Mulan?</code></li>

  <li>Back at the crowded courtyard, relatives compliment the Fa parents</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚ÄúEveryone is here, especially when their cousin is a perfect bride and a perfect daughter!‚Äù ‚ÄúYour daughter, Mulan, is worth seven sons!‚Äù</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shang‚Äôs mother hugs him proudly, ‚ÄúYour father would‚Äôve been so proud of you.‚Äù</code></li>
  <li>The duo wade through relatives, and disagree on things. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Her parents comment, ‚ÄúPerhaps a not-so-perfect husband.‚Äù</code>
</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mulan expresses to some young cousins that she is basically being plucked away from her own family, and grafted into Shang‚Äôs. It‚Äôs gonna be tough duty.</code></li>
  <li>An imperial messenger announces before everyone, ‚Äú<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The Emperor sends his congratulations!‚ÄîAnd also</code> a special summon to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secret</code> urgent mission<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚Äîhopefully the couple accepts.</code>‚Äù</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mulan thinks that it would be a dishonour to accept the mission and postpone the marriage when the relatives are all here already. Shang overrules her that it would be a dishonour to refuse this request from the Emperor, especially in front of the entire family.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">They purposely accept the call.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Later, in the barn:</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Papa Fa also gives Shan Yu‚Äôs sword for Mulan to use , as well as put a flower in her hair. He repeats, ‚ÄúThe greatest honour is having you as my daughter.‚Äù</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="15-palace-quest">1.5 Palace Quest</h3>

<ul>
  <li>They arrive at the palace.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚ÄúAh, General Li Shang, the most dutiful man in all of China, just as his father before him. There is no one else I‚Äôd rather appoint to lead this important mission. And I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs no one else you‚Äôd rather have beside you than Fa Mulan, a warrior worth ten thousand men‚Äîalso, your fiance. Congratulations, by the way.‚Äù</code></li>
  <li>The Emperor explains the quest:
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Last of the Huns are one big nomadic group, raiding our cities</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Taking advantage of Shan Yu‚Äôs mostly successful military campaign from the previous movie</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The number of fit males-of-age are too depleted.</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">In Mulan I, they relaxed the conscription conditions, so desperation is why they extended the conscripted Mulan‚Äôs old father, along with Shang‚Äôs troop made up of previously ‚Äúunfit for war‚Äù males like the Gang of Three</code></li>
      <li>Instead: we will send princesses to make an alliance with a neighbouring kingdom.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mulan <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doesn‚Äôt</code>react about arranged marriages, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">but does voice her concern for the princesses:</code> the Emperor replies that they understand their duty and accept the honour.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shang asks why the alliance demands marriage. Reply: Emperor Qin is demanding and unhonourable‚Äîbut he‚Äôs our last hope.</code></li>
  <li>The Emperor provides them an entourage <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with a squad of palace guards</code>
    <ul>
      <li>Shang requests to have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">an additional</code> three special unit soldiers‚Ä¶</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="16-the-gang-of-three">1.6 The Gang of Three</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The Matchmaker kicks the Gang of Three out. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚ÄúYou three are WORSE than Mulan! Better hope you have her luck!‚Äù</code>
</li>
  <li>They sing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a shorter</code> A Girl Worth Fighting For (Redux): how they‚Äôve returned from war, fulfilling the expectations of a man, yet not yet found a girl</li>
  <li>Mulan and Shang enter, and recruit them</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="17-leaving-the-palace">1.7 Leaving the Palace</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The three princesses (Mei, Ting-Ting and Su) enter the carriage, hiding their faces with their fans. Mei drops her shoe. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None of the entourage notices (Remember, they have an entourage now).</code>
</li>
  <li>Yao deliberates, then decides to pick it for her. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mei mutters, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just the guard ‚Äì it‚Äôs not your duty to do that.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, but it would be my honour.‚Äù Mei blushes. Yao runs back, his heart racing.</code>
</li>
  <li>Shang swears their safety, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">on the basis of his generalship.</code>
</li>
  <li>Mulan prods them<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">: she herself was matchmade to local men, but they would stay forever in a foreign land</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">They affirm that just as Mulan saved their kingdom with the sword, they can save the kingdom with their marriages. As Mulan honoured her father, they must honour the Emperor.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mulan mulls, and starts a thought: ‚ÄúYou know when I took my father‚Äôs place in the army, I had to sneak out without my father knowing, right? Oh! We‚Äôre going.‚Äù</code></li>
  <li>As brazen as they show themselves to be, but when alone, the princesses sigh sadly.</li>
  <li>Mulan and Shang say aloud they should just about make the 3-day-deadline</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="act-2a">Act 2A</h2>

<h3 id="2a1-reactions-on-the-road">2A.1 Reactions on the Road</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Mulan and Shang discuss the arranged marriages in light of their own happy one.
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shang: ‚ÄúA soldiers‚Äô duty is to die in war; a princess‚Äô duty is to live in an arranged marriage.‚Äù</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mushu tells Cri-Kee that he‚Äôd test the relationship, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">just to be ‚Äúreally sure that Shang was worth him losing Mulan‚Äù</code>. With <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">only a sligh thint of</code>selfishness.</li>
  <li>Yao expresses his infatuation to the Gang of Three, but the other two remind him that these princesses are engaged,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and that to be entrusted as a royal escort was the highest honour for a soldier. Who could ever ask for more? Yao huffs.</code>
</li>
  <li>Mei simps over Yao to her sisters. Ting-Ting reminds her of the solemn oath, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the consequences and the great dishonour she would bring.</code> They hide their faces with their fans again.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2a2-water-break">2A.2 Water Break</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The princesses are allowed out of their carriage.</li>
  <li>Mei pours her heart out to Yao, who is surprisingly a smooth talker. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚ÄúSometimes, I feel like I‚Äôm worth nothing.‚Äù Reply: ‚ÄúRight now, you‚Äôre worth more than all our lives combined!‚Äù</code>
</li>
  <li>Su struggles to pick fruits, and Chien-Po hoists her up, to her delight.</li>
  <li>Ting-Ting spies on them. Ling tries to woo her with jokes, but Ting-Ting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hides her face in her fan, stifling what sounds to be a disgusted noise.</code> She books it.</li>
  <li>Mei compliments how honourable Mulan was to take her father‚Äôs place in the army.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mulan: ‚ÄúYes, I went for my father; but I also went to prove my heart.‚Äù</code></li>
  <li>Mei asks, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Which is more honourable:</code> following your duty, or following your heart?‚Äù</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mulan replies, "The highest honour is to let both duty and heart guide you."</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2a3-runaway-carriage">2A.3 Runaway Carriage</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">We see shadows hiding in the grassfields. Hun assassins whisper, ‚ÄúSo our scouts were right‚Äîwe need to prevent the alliance.‚Äù</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The Huns AMBUSH. Amazing fight sequence. Mulan executes a tactical plan with the help of Mushu that wins the upper hand.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mushu lights a firecracker/smoke bomb combo that Mulan tosses into the field. The Huns are visually and audibly blind, causing them to fight each other.</code></li>
  <li>Mushu sabotages Shang<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚Äîprematurely igniting his bomb. It goes off while on him, spooking the carriage horses.</code>
</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">This accidentally causes</code> the carriage with the princesses to runaway <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and break from the main fight.</code>
</li>
  <li>The gang <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and some enemies break off to</code> catch the runaway carriage. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The main entourage soldiers are busy fighting</code>
</li>
  <li>They travel quite far; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the gang has to jump the carriage across a chasm.</code>
</li>
  <li>The carriage is destroyed.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The Huns retreat for a more opportune moment.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The entourage arrive at the chasm, but cannot cross it.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">They establish it would take at least a day to route the chasm. Shang shouts across, ‚ÄúTo make the deadline, we must travel without the entourage!‚Äù</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2a4-conflicting-plans">2A.4 Conflicting Plans</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Mulan and Shang quarrel over how to travel. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">And who was to blame for the runaway carriage?</code>
</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mushu feels bad for sabo‚Äôing Shang, and decides to do the dutiful thing to aid the marriage.

  <li>The couple apologise: they both acknowledge they both must be more gentle. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">They note that before Chien-Po finishes his watch shift, they can do some sparring practice: their way of reconciling.</code>
</li>
  <li>The Gang of Three try to impress the princesses.</li>
  <li>Mei teases Ting-Ting, but Ting-Ting leans too much on duty, while Mei leans too much on heart.</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚ÄúHow can you hide from your duty?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow can you hide from who you really are?‚Äù</code> Mei storms out.</li>

<h3 id="2a5-princesses-break">2A.5 Princesses Break</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Mei throws away her fan and pens a goodbye/runaway letter.</li>
  <li>Her sisters catch her in the act: ‚ÄúAll this because some guard gave you his heart?!‚Äù</li>
  <li>‚ÄúNo! It‚Äôs not about his heart, it‚Äôs about MINE. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">This‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt who</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I</code></em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">am inside.</code>‚Äù</li>

  <li>Her sisters break out into Like Other Girls: They all fantasize a life without duties and all heart. (without the racist part)</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BUT, at the end of the song, Ting-Ting hardens again:</code>
    <ul>

</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-screenplay-edited">Mushu blows a flame onto one of the bombs, and it goes off with a BANG!

SHANG
An ambush!

MULAN
I think one of the bombs just exploded by itself.

They run over to their supplies pile. Scorch marks stain and ruin various items.

SHANG
Our supplies are ruined! Mulan, you were supposed to watch the bombs!

MULAN
No, it becomes your duty after sunset!

They clean up the mess. Mushu and Cri-Kee watch them closely, hidden in a tree.

MUSHU
It's working!

SHANG
The runaway carriage was not my fault, and I'm sure it wasn't an accident. I'm an elite soldier ‚Äî nothing gets past me.

Without warning, Mulan crashes a bo staff down onto Shang from behind.

Shang rolls out of the way, aghast.

MULAN
(smirking)
I got past you, didn't I?

Mulan continues attacking, so Shang ditches the supplies and picks a bo staff of his own to spar.

SHANG
Are you taking the mission seriously?

MULAN
Tonight would‚Äôve been our honeymoon night, so, no, I‚Äôm not! Are YOU taking our MARRIAGE seriously?

Mulan's attack causes Shang to step back, and pause.

SHANG
(solemn)
Listen, Mulan. If somehow, during the mission... I somehow... die... will you complete the mission?

MULAN
(appalled)
If you DIED?! Why would you DIE?!

They continue, but Mulan starts throwing fatal blows.

SHANG
Because of the mission! I just said so! It‚Äôs a simple question ‚Äî why‚Äôs it so hard to give me a simple answer?

MULAN
(talking over each other)
You can‚Äôt die! We were supposed to be married! What kind of question is that?!

Mulan sends Shang's staff flying, jabbing her own staff at Shang‚Äôs neck in victory.

MULAN
I told you we SHOULDN'T have come on this mission.

Shang wrestles the staff out of Mulan‚Äôs hands, reversing their position.

SHANG
No ‚Äì I need to do this mission.

MULAN
(softens)
Shang ‚Äì tell me what‚Äôs on your heart.

SHANG
(waves it off)
Nothing. I‚Äôm going to rest before tomorrow‚Äôs journey. Good night.

Shang tosses away his staff and heads into his tent. Mulan takes over the night watch with Mushu.

  <li>The other two sisters look to Ting-Ting and she can‚Äôt bear their hurt. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">She huddles them together and whispers, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to spend the rest of our lives following our duty. You both get one night to follow your heart.‚Äù</code>

<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The sisters bittersweetly nod yes.</code> The Gang of Three celebrate! And lead them off.</li>
  <li>Mushu sees this and informs Mulan, who leaves.</li>

<h3 id="2b1-the-festival">2B.1 The Festival</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Su and Chien Po bond over picking out food</li>
  <li>Yao tries to impress Mei with his strength, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">by stopping an escaping thief. The thief rages. Yao decides against whacking him further, instead gently correcting him by teaching him his own anger issues techniques, impressing Mei further.</code>
</li>
  <li>Ling wooes Ting-Ting with more jokes but she just turns away, making some gagging noise.</li>
  <li>Ling admits defeat, accidentally lighting firecrackers. Ting-Ting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">accidentally drops her fan,</code> letting out a snorty laugh.</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">She reveals she had been taught to suppress her un-princess-like laughter.</code> Ling says he loves her for it; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">she replies that he‚Äôd be the first.</code>
</li>
  <li>Time jump to the end of the night. The three pairs bask in the fleeting moment over a bridge. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">They look in their</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reflection</code></strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">: Yes‚Äîthis is who they are inside.</code>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2b2-breaking-up">2B.2 Breaking Up</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">An archer has his sights aimed on Mei. He releases the arrow ‚Äî but it‚Äôs cut out of the air by Mulan‚Äôs sword.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The pairs scatter ‚Äî Huns run along the rooftops chasing each pair. The guards put up a very good fight, but there's just too many.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shang enters, taking on a whole group of them, and at one point he would‚Äôve died had not Yao saved him.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The Huns flee again.</code></li>
  <li>Shang confronts the guards for endangering the mission, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saying how they should be executed right there for treason.</code>
</li>
  <li>Mulan steps in, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defending them that it would‚Äôve been worse to have been ambushed in the woods. Besides, at one moment, Yao saved Shang's life ‚Äî just like Mulan did back in the first movie.</code>
</li>
  <li>But Shang <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">harshly shushes her,</code> puts his foot down and forbids the pairs to talk.</li>
  <li>Now alone, Shang blames Mulan for filling their minds with heart over duty. Mulan replies that Shang was too uptight, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and that the guards gave the princesses honour by taking them out one last night. ‚ÄúIn marriage, women leave their family, not the men ‚Äî and sometimes, they rarely ever get to visit. These three young girls will never return home forever. Not that you‚Äôd understand.‚Äù</code>
</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shang huffs, ‚ÄúMen, all across the nation, way too young and far too old ‚Äî they CHOSE to honour some parchment bearing their family name. I understand perfectly that almost all of them, my father included, NEVER came back home to their mothers, wives‚Ä¶ and children. [pause] At his age, your father wouldn‚Äôt have, either.‚Äù</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">That‚Äôs a low blow. Mulan fumes through tears of anger, ‚ÄúShang! Don‚Äôt you dare speak about my father like that‚Äì‚Äú</code></li>
  <li>Shang <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">affirms he won‚Äôt bring dishonour to his father‚Äôs death to the Huns to be in vain, and</code> assumes leadership. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">They give each other the cold shoulder.</code>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2b3-confession-valley">2B.3 Confession Valley</h3>

<ul>
  <li>They all silently make their way down a narrow pass.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ting-Ting tries to crack a joke with Ling when Shang wasn‚Äôt looking, but Ling doesn‚Äôt break.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ting-Ting chucks a pebble into the distance in a fit. It soars over the walls, tumbling down, and knocks the back of a Hun. There‚Äôs a huge Hun camp nearby; they investigate.</code></li>
  <li>Mulan lags behind, and Mushu confesses that he‚Äôs been sabotaging Shang. Mulan is deeply hurt, and says he‚Äôs unforgivable.<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Yet, she acknowledges that Shang and herself have escalated the problems on their own.</code>
</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Still, Mulan affirms she will not marry Shang if he goes down this road of extreme duty.</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2b4-ambush">2B.4 Ambush</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ohno they get ambushed again. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mulan throws some firecracker/smoke bombs like last time, but the Huns bat it all back like baseball. Shang takes a hit for Mulan.</code>
</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mushu fights and bravely defeats an enemy wolf.</code></li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A Hun</code> captures Mei. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">About to kill her, his boss stops him. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt kill her, you fool! Use her as a hostage for her sisters!‚Äù</code>
</li>
  <li>Shang and Mulan chase them to a bridge over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ferocious rapids</code>. Shang saves and retrieves Mei, and she runs off the bridge to solid ground.</li>
  <li>The duo take out many of the Huns along the bridge, but the Huns cut the rope.</li>
  <li>The flailing bridge is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">swept downstream by the coursing river, and the duo are thrown off-kilter. The guards hold the bridge in place from their end.</code>
</li>
  <li>Mulan and Shang fall into the river. Mulan grabs a rope hanging by its thread. Shang holds onto and weighs on her, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">being pulled by the current.</code>
</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚ÄúThe rope can‚Äôt hold us both. A soldier‚Äôs duty is to die in war, huh? ‚Ä¶You‚Äôre the craziest person I‚Äôve ever met. It is my honour to owe you my life.‚Äù</code></li>
  <li>With that, Shang lets go <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gets swept under by the currents. The guard trio retract the rope, finding Mulan alone and wailing.</code>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2b5-grief">2B.5 Grief</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The three pairs solemnly take shelter under a rock as it rains that night.</li>
  <li>Mulan grieves in the rain, with Shang‚Äôs sword <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and helmet</code>: what‚Äôs left of him.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">She looks into the torrenting river, hard to make out her reflection.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚ÄúLook at me: I will never pass for a perfect bride; or a perfect soldier. Can it be; I‚Äôm not meant to choose my heart? Now I see; that if I were truly to be myself‚Ä¶ I could never play my part.‚Äù</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">She holds her sword to her hair‚Äîthis time instead of cutting it, she cuts her hairband, letting out her long hair.</code></li>
  <li>WIth a loud wail against a thundercrack, she drives the sword into the ground. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">She sets Shang‚Äôs helmet on it, just like his father‚Äôs grave.</code>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2b6-the-palace">2B.6 The Palace</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Next morning, the guards and princesses awaken. Mulan‚Äôs gone.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">They note that her sword and uniform were left here, but Mei‚Äôs own makeup and one of her dresses are missing.</code></li>
  <li>Cut to the Qui Gong palace.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mulan (offscreen) implores to Emperor Qin to not require the arranged marriage, but he stubbornly doesn‚Äôt even look at her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have to convince the entire kingdom before convincing me!‚Äù</code></li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The camera pans and we finally see</code> Mulan, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all prettied up in Mei‚Äôs dress, vows and</code>offers herself instead in marriage for the alliance.</li>
  <li>Emperor Qin‚Äòs counsellors tell him, ‚ÄúThis is Fa Mulan, the hero who saved China! She is worth more than three princesses!‚Äù</li>
  <li>Emperor Qin accepts the offer, and introduces his crown prince.</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shang walks through the door. Mulan is shocked; she shakes her head.</code>It‚Äôs just the crown prince, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a regular looking guy. She‚Äôs grieving and hallucinating.</code>
</li>
  <li>Qin announces the wedding will be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">later at sunset</code>!</li>

<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">As the afternoon sun fades,</code> the princesses and Gang of Three connect the dots and realise where Mulan‚Äôs went.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">They stumble upon the Hun camp. They overhear that the Huns will make a small attack during the wedding (but to be conservative, saving troops for the later war).</code></li>
  <li>The gang hastens towards the palace. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚ÄúThey wouldn‚Äôt believe us if we warned them. We need another way in‚Ä¶ oh no, I feel a deja vu coming up.‚Äù</code>
</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Back with the Huns, they continue talking, ‚ÄúDid you see that Chinese soldier who fell into the river?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, he looks just like that general we fought a year ago at that village!‚Äù</code></li>

  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">She mumbles to herself, ‚ÄúYou defeat armies‚Ä¶ but to them, you‚Äôre still just a woman to marry.‚Äù</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mushu steps out of hiding. ‚ÄúWhen you marry this prince, I‚Äôll lose you tonight.‚Äù</code></li>

  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The handmaidens come back to finish her make-up, then stand to the side as</code> she is revealed before the citizens on the palace stage.</li>
  <li>She walks up to the crown prince. Emperor Qin, who‚Äôs officiating the wedding, hands her a goblet as he makes his speech. She looks down wistfully in her reflection in the goblet.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shadowed figures silently take out the guards at posts. A shadowed figure takes out other shadowed figures. Huh?</code></li>
  <li>Qin ties a sash between the pair, symbolically uniting two lives and the two kingdoms.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Qin asks Mulan to affirm the marriage, who glances one last goodbye to Mushu. She opens her mouth to repeat the vow‚Ä¶</code></li>

  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚ÄúWhere are my guards?‚Äù Huns have been stealthily taking out most of the guards already. Cut to a bulky silhouette tearing through palace guards and Huns alike.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A few Huns make it to the crown prince, and though Mulan protects him successfully, they are forced back. ‚ÄúInto the palace and lock the doors!‚Äù</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">They lock the doors, but some Huns enter from the windows. They all split up.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">While the Huns pursue the other palace guards, some palace guards hide the three princes in a hiding spot.</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mulan is slowly backed into a dead end corridor with her defenseless handmaidens. She‚Äôs hopelessly outnumbered.</code></li>
