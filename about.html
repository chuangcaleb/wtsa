I’m a final-year student procrastinating his dissertation for his Computer Science with AI degree. I’ve published a few random coding projects here and there. I also really, really love story Story: books, movies, songs, theatre, musicals. Narratives. Not so much the writing style, like grammar, word choice, descriptive language, etc. Though the skill of conveying information through a medium efficiently and artfully may be part-and-parcel of story. No, I’m more specifically talking about the age-old practice of storytelling: finding universal truths of human experience and translating them into cohesive drama. No, I’m more specifically talking about the age-old practice of storytelling: finding universal truths of human experience and translating them into cohesive drama.

<p>Hello there—my name is Caleb!</p>

<p>I’m a final-year student procrastinating his dissertation for his Computer Science with AI degree. I’ve published a few random coding projects <a href="https://github.com/chuangcaleb" class="web-link">here</a> and <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/calebchan/" class="web-link">there</a>.</p>

<h2 id="i-also-really-really-love-story">I also really, really love <strong>story</strong>
</h2>

<p>Story: books, movies, songs, theatre, musicals. <em>Narratives</em>.</p>

<p>Not so much the <a href="https://helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/a-writer-or-a-storyteller/" class="web-link">writing style</a>, like grammar, word choice, descriptive language, etc. Though the skill of <em>conveying information through a medium <strong>efficiently</strong> and <strong>artfully</strong></em> may be part-and-parcel of <strong>story</strong>.</p>

<p>No, I’m more specifically talking about the age-old practice of <strong>storytelling</strong>: <em>finding <strong>universal truths</strong> of human experience and translating them into <strong>cohesive drama</strong></em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I believe stories have such a resonant effect on people: they have shaped lives and defined societies. Human history itself is a story being written and told. Story runs in our veins, whether we like it or not, and everything <em>is</em> story.</p>

<p>And after years of searching for my own place, I’ve finally found something I’m not too bad at: intuitively understanding the interconnected web of story. It’s going to change so many lives.</p>

<h2 id="story-on-paper">Story on paper</h2>

<p>People know this about me: after a really interesting movie, I <em>have</em> to discuss the movie with someone. There’s so much to evaluate and critique and digest. I needed somewhere to dump my thoughts.</p>

<p>I tried running <a href="https://instagram.com/whatsthestoryabout" class="web-link">an Instagram account</a> for a while (a good while!), but I ended up taking more time designing than actually writing out things.</p>

<p>Through my Computer Science degree, I started using <a href="https://obsidian.md" class="web-link">Obsidian</a> and learnt about the amazing <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org" class="web-link">Markdown</a> format (a common language in the coding field!). Then I thought, why not integrate <a href="https://obsidian.md" class="web-link">Obsidian</a> with my writing escapades? I learnt and practiced even more to be able to maintain a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" class="web-link">Jekyll</a> site, which helps me quickly compile my Markdown scribblings, autogenerates their appropriate website-matter, and effortlessly publishes them online!</p>

<p>Which brings us here. So this website-blog-space-area is my external dump of all the thoughts in my head. Nothing too fancy, no special theme styling: just focus on getting everything out of my head, and onto this digital paper.</p>
