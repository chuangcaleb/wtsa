<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A friend had told me about a Chinese-culture based animated musical on Netflix, based on the mooncake folktale. As a Chinese, this show would be either hit or miss.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>We watched it while in quarantine isolation, right before New Year’s.</p>

<p>The very first thing that really struck a chord, was seeing my own culture in a musical narrative — the intro song about the Chinese folktale, and then just having a song about making mooncakes. I’ve never been particularly nationalistic about my ethnicity, but this film really made me swell with pride.</p>

<p>🚨 Spoiler Alert! 🚨 Everything that follows is spoiler territory, obviously…</p>

<h2 id="things-id-tweak">Things I’d Tweak</h2>

<h3 id="1-the-solution-in-the-climax">1. The solution in the climax</h3>

<p>So what happens is that after Haoyi fades away again, Chang’e plunges the Moon into The Big <del>Sad</del> Darkness. She encases herself in the Chamber of Exquisite Sadness, and no one can get in through the barrier. Except, Fei Fei can pass through, deciding to risk talking to Chang’e, but Fei Fei herself sees visions of her mother, and gets trapped inside herself.</p>

<p>Then what happens is that Chang’e sees and sings to Fei Fei, telling her she has to move on — a lesson that’s obvious that she herself doesn’t understand.</p>

<p>And it’s shown to work — two broken people sing to, encourage and advise each other. They break free of their own <del>depression</del> Big Darknesses, and then Lunaria is restored to light, and everyone’s happy.</p>

<p>I guess that’s a good message. Two broken people helping each other up.</p>

<p>But I believe that the climax can be even more powerful. Let’s review the thematic statement of the show:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can move on from the pain of the loved ones you lost, by accepting the love that new people pour into you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This are the ultimate climax arcs that both Fei Fei and Chang’e have to learn to grow as characters. Both Houyi and Fei Fei’s mom have passed, and both Chang’e and Fei Fei rejected and pushed away the new people that offered love to them: Gobi and Chin.</p>

<p>But, <em>I felt</em> that this isn’t clearly shown in the climax — there wasn’t a point that <em>proved</em> that the entrance of a new love made any impactful difference in their lives. To me at least, it seemed like <strong>Gobi and Chin should have been the catalyst for the climactic moment.</strong></p>

<p>Chin literally breaks through the wall of depression — this is how</p>

<p>And then Bungee uses her purple electric magic ear powers, proving that you even magical power isn’t strong enough—and proving that Chin’s love is stronger than magic.</p>

<h3 id="gobis-song">Gobi’s song</h3>

<h3 id="2-why-cant-haoyi-stay">2. Why can’t Haoyi stay?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fei Fei asking for a portion of the potion, and turns out both their potions are not enough</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="changes-new-loved-ones">Chang’e’s new loved ones</h3>

<h3 id="3-foreshadowing-the-gift">3. Foreshadowing “the Gift”</h3>

<p>I don’t just want the photo anymore — I want a part of the potion that can revive my mom.</p>

<p>Saving the mooncake — She must’ve had the mooncake for months? Why not this: Mrs. Zhong could still offer her a mooncake on the first Mid Autumn Festival, the first time they met. Fei Fei can still dismiss her mooncake entirely, her dialogue, “I don’t want IT… Urgh! And I don’t want YOU.”</p>

<p>Then, assuming the rocket took two years to build (and Chin and Mrs. Zhong have been around for two years too), Mrs. Zhong could be giving Fei Fei a mooncake every year.</p>

<p>Then after two years, Fei Fei is about take off before the Festival and Mrs. Chin catches Fei Fei on the way out, including the family heirloom this time.</p>

<h3 id="the-biker-chicks-motivation">The Biker Chicks’ motivation</h3>

<h3 id="the-ping-pong-match-point">The ping pong match point</h3>

<hr>

<h2 id="things-i-liked">Things I Liked</h2>

<h3 id="grounded-internal-conflict">Grounded internal conflict</h3>

<p>In light of cosmic beings and deep folklore, the story could’ve gone into epic-scale wars or some galaxy-spanning McGuffin hunt. But instead, the story quickly set up the tight father-mother-daughter family relationship that fuels Fei Fei’s motivation for every goal in every scene thereafter.</p>

<p>And then instead of some magical enemy who steals Fei Fei’s mom away, we have something more familiar relatable: some generic terminal illness. It’s so… normal.</p>

<p>I’ve always admired stories that know how to reinforce their stories (like reinforcing concrete with steel) with a simple but powerful internal conflict that quietly and invisibly gives shape as the backbone of every scene.</p>

<p>I can’t imagine how powerful this story will be to so, so many kids (and adults) who have lost a loved one. I can’t imagine how much good lessons we would’ve so easily lost if the plot had slipped into bland spectacle somewhere in production.</p>

<h3 id="attaching-meaning-to-the-folktale">Attaching meaning to the folktale</h3>

<p>Also very nicely mirrored Fei Fei and Chang’e</p>

<p>Fei Fei meaning fly, Chang’e is literally change,</p>

<h3 id="the-dinner-scene">The dinner scene</h3>

<p>Fei Fei defends Chang’e from her aunties, when really the subtext is that she’s defending herself</p>

<h3 id="consistency-and-depth-with-chin">Consistency and depth with Chin</h3>

<h3 id="losing-bungee">Losing Bungee</h3>

<p>Leaving Bungee behind was Fei Fei’s final test on whether she could move on or not</p>

<hr>

<p>I thought they might want to introduce reviving Fei Fei’s mom.</p>
