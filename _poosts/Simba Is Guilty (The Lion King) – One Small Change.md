# Make Simba Guilty (The Lion King)

<!--more-->

> ðŸš¨ **Spoiler Alert!** ðŸš¨ Everything that follows is spoiler territory, obviouslyâ€¦

## Introduction

The Lion King is one of my favorite stories. It's a tale as old as time: the naive young prince brags about one day becoming King, but one day he makes a very foolish decision, from which the King/his father sacrifices himself to save his son from.

The prince flees his kingdom ashamed and tries to bury his past under a new start in a new life in a new land. And it all seems to be perfect, until he hears that his kingdom was taken over by his tyrant uncle, and that he needs to claim his rightful throne to save the land: but that would involve bravely owning up to his mistakes in front of his mother and friends.

The Prodigal Son must stop running, come home, and face his fears and failures head-on. In the words of Raifiki, "You can either run from [your mistakes]â€¦ or learn from it!" The message is loud and clear: **you can't outrun your mistakes, instead, you must bravely run *towards* them**, which entails accepting the harsh consequences/reality, but also growing wiser to not make the same mistake again.

But what mistake _did_ Simba have to face?

## Scar has been 100% to blame

I think the revealing answer is in the climactic dialogue:

```screenplay
SEQ. 19 (THE FIGHT)

EXT. PRIDE ROCK - DUSK

SCAR
Always rushing headlong into trouble -- But "Daddy" was always there to save you. As I recall, "Daddy" died trying to save you.

SIMBA
It was an accident.

SCAR
And that's why you ran away?
(to Sarabi)
Not very kingly, eh?

[...]

[Simba] dangles off the edge of the rock, his claws losing their hold with each passing second.

Simba doesn't know it, but he is in the exact same position his father was before his death. Scar savors the moment.

SCAR
Now this looks familiar. Where have I seen this before? Let me think...
(brightening)
Oh, yes -- I remember! That's just the way your father looked before I killed him.

Simba ROARS and leaps for Scar, hitting him like a freight train. They fight. Simba flips Scar. The hyenas freeze while Simba holds Scar down:

SIMBA
You killed him! All this time, I hated myself -- when you're the one who did it!

Scar calls to his army:

SCAR
Help me, you idiots!

Scar's legions rally around him. Scar and Simba fight through the crush of hyenas.
```

You could say:

- **Simba's mistake was that he was in the valley in the first place.** But while Scar previously uses Simba's pride (heh) against him to lure him to the dangerous elephant graveyard, this time Scar outright just guilt trips Simba into going into the valley. You can't blame a small child for being guilt-tripped by a cunning manipulator. Scar is 100% to blame here for Mufasa's death.

```screenplay
SCAR
Just stay on this rock. You wouldn't want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas.
```

- **Simba's mistake was that he fled Pride Rock as a child.** But at that moment, it could be justified in that such a traumatic event like his father's death would leave any child vulnerable to manipulation, and that Scar should be totally at fault for taking advantage of his naÃ¯vetÃ©.

- **Simba's mistake was that he never returned to Pride Rock earlier.** Now this could also somewhat be justified together with the previous statement(s), that the childhood trauma and external manipulation from Scar should be to blame.

And credit to the writers, to make Scar the iconic manipulative sociopath that he is. The key to making an effective antagonist is to make them/their actions **actively responsible** for the plot outcomes that push our protagonist down the tough path.

## Then what mistake does Simba really have to face?

But at the end of the day, when all the cards are revealed, Simba says: **"You killed him! All this time, I hated myself -- when you're the one who did it!"** This suggests that Simba is washing his hands clean of his father's blood, because to him, Scar had been pulling all the strings, while Simba was just a young, innocent puppet.

And I'd have to agree. Without even needing to defend the points above, the script lends itself to this conclusion. When Simba finally accuses Scar, Scar doesn't even defend himself, not even one bitâ€”he quickly concedes his own argument and incites the fistfight, as if that was easier to win than the argument.

```screenplay
SIMBA
You killed him! All this time, I hated myself -- when you're the one who did it!

Scar calls to his army:

SCAR
Help me, you idiots!
```

Depending on how far you are willing to see it, if Scar is (essentially) fully to blame, then Simba has no real/actual/substantial mistake for him to be running away *from*. More importantly, then Simba has no real mistake for him to learn from. Then what weight/stakes does Simba's character arc really have?

> If Scar is fully to blame, then Simba has no real mistake for him to be running away from. More importantly, then Simba has no real mistake for him to learn from.
> 
> Then what weight/stakes does Simba's character arc really have?

If Simba had nothing to apologize for, then if someone (e.g. Raifiki) had just told him that Scar had killed his father at anytime during his self-imposed exile (as opposed to the right at the end of the movie), **then Simba could've/would've just returned earlier, and the story resolves exactly the same way**â€”without need for Simba's wilderness/exile character development. Instead of a story about learning from your mistakes (which it has been building up to), then it becomes a story about persevering to find the truth.

Then, if it's not a story about learning from your mistakes, then what's the story about?â„¢ Where's the thematic resonance? Onto the one small change.

## (Not) Confessing crucial information

But first, a side note: it also sometimes breaks suspension of disbelief during the climax when Scar simply [gloats and reveals crucial information, when the smart villain would've just ended the hero right there](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe).

```screenplay
Scar savors the moment.

SCAR
Now this looks familiar. Where have I seen this before?
[...]
That's just the way your father looked before I killed him.

SIMBA
Why would you admit to that, especially now? (not actual dialogue)
```

Why did Scar just admit to his own crime, and give Simba the moral high ground? Of course, it's in character and is the natural progression to the plot, and this is just me nitpicking the scene because I honestly don't find it that big a deal but might as well bring it up while on topicâ€¦ but this confession feels halfway to a [dues ex machina](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina).

In one simple villain mistake, all of Simba's problems and insecurities are resolved, and while there is still physical life-or-death tension in the battle, however, the intellectual thematic tension suddenly leaps to completion.

## The one small change: make Simba guilty

[The Secret to Writing Dynamic Characters: It's Always Their Fault - Helping Writers Become Authors](https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/secret-writing-dynamic-characters-always-fault/) is one of my favorite posts from the [Helping Writers Become Authors](https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com) blog that I <span style="text-decoration:underline;">always</span> find myself coming back to. Because, in every analysis, the discriminatory factor that makes or breaks a story, is almost always exactly this: whether the characters are at fault.

Now to
