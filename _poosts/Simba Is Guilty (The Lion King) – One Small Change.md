# Make Simba Guilty (The Lion King)

If there's one small change that I could make to The Lion King, perhaps it could've been in the live-action remake or stage musical, it would be this: Simba's pride directly causedâ€¦

<!--more-->

> ðŸš¨ **Spoiler Alert!** ðŸš¨ Everything that follows is spoiler territory, obviouslyâ€¦

## Introduction

The Lion King is one of my favorite stories. It's a tale as old as time: the naive young prince brags about one day becoming King, but one day he makes a very foolish decision, from which the King/his father sacrifices himself to save his son from.

The prince flees his kingdom ashamed and tries to bury his past under a new start in a new life in a new land. And it all seems to be perfect, until he hears that his kingdom was taken over by his tyrant uncle, and that he needs to claim his rightful throne to save the land: but that would involve bravely owning up to his mistakes in front of his mother and friends.

The Prodigal Son must stop running, come home, and face his fears and failures head-on. In the words of Raifiki, "You can either run from [your mistakes]â€¦ or learn from it!" The message is loud and clear: **you can't outrun your mistakes, instead, you must bravely run *towards* them**, which entails accepting the harsh consequences/reality, but also growing wiser to not make the same mistake again.

But what mistake *did* Simba have to face?

## Scrutinizing the story

### Scar has been 100% to blame

I think the revealing answer is in the climactic dialogue:

```screenplay
SEQ. 19 (THE FIGHT)

EXT. PRIDE ROCK - DUSK

SCAR
Always rushing headlong into trouble -- But "Daddy" was always there to save you. As I recall, "Daddy" died trying to save you.

SIMBA
It was an accident.

SCAR
And that's why you ran away?
(to Sarabi)
Not very kingly, eh?

[...]

[Simba] dangles off the edge of the rock, his claws losing their hold with each passing second.

Simba doesn't know it, but he is in the exact same position his father was before his death. Scar savors the moment.

SCAR
Now this looks familiar. Where have I seen this before? Let me think...
(brightening)
Oh, yes -- I remember! That's just the way your father looked before he died.

Simba slips, but Scar digs his claws into Simba's, just like he did with Mufasa.

SCAR (CONT'D)
And here's my little secret.
(whispering)
I killed Mufasa.

[flashback, cool transition]

Simba ROARS and leaps for Scar, hitting him like a freight train. Simba flips Scar. The hyenas freeze while Simba pins Scar down:

SIMBA
Murderer!

SCAR
No, Simba, please!

SIMBA
Tell them the truth.

[...]

Simba's paw puts pressure on Scar's throat.

SCAR
(choking)
Alright! I did it.

SIMBA
(darkly)
So they can hear you.

SCAR
(louder)
I killed Mufasa.

The lionesses pounce into action at the words. A dozen hyenas pile onto Simba. A fight ensues.
```

You could say:

- **Simba's mistake was that he was in the gorge in the first place.** But while Scar previously uses Simba's pride (heh) against him to lure him to the dangerous elephant graveyard, this time Scar outright just guilt trips Simba into going into the gorge. You can't blame a small child for being guilt-tripped by a cunning manipulator. Scar is 100% to blame here for Mufasa's death.

```screenplay
SCAR
Just stay on this rock. You wouldn't want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas.
```

- **Simba's mistake was that he fled Pride Rock as a child.** But at that moment, it could be justified in that such a traumatic event like his father's death would leave any child vulnerable to manipulation, and that Scar should be totally at fault for taking advantage of his naÃ¯vetÃ©.

- **Simba's mistake was that he never returned to Pride Rock earlier.** Now this could also somewhat be justified together with the previous statement(s), that the childhood trauma and external manipulation from Scar should be to blame.

And credit to the writers, to make Scar the iconic manipulative sociopath that he is. The key to making an effective antagonist is to make them/their actions **actively responsible** for the plot outcomes that push our protagonist down the tough path.

### Then what mistake does Simba really have to face?

But at the end of the day, when all the cards are revealed, Simba says: "Murderer!" As cool as Simba looks with pure fury when he slowly makes his way to Scar through fire, the line suggests that Simba is washing his hands clean of his father's blood, because to him, Scar had been pulling all the strings, while Simba was just a young, innocent puppet.

And I'd have to agree. Without even needing to defend the points above, the script lends itself to this conclusion. When Simba finally accuses Scar, Scar doesn't even defend himself, not even one bitâ€”he quickly concedes his own argument and surrenders.

```screenplay
SIMBA
Murderer!

SCAR
No, Simba, please!

SIMBA
Tell them the truth.
```

Depending on how far you perceive it: if Scar is (essentially) fully to blame, then Simba has no real/actual/substantial mistake for him to be running away *from*. More importantly, then Simba has no real mistake for him to learn from. Then what weight/stakes does Simba's character arc really have?

> If Scar is fully to blame, then Simba has no real mistake for him to be running away from. More importantly, then Simba has no real mistake for him to learn from.
>
> Then what weight/stakes does Simba's character arc really have?

If Simba had nothing to apologize for, then if someone (e.g. Raifiki) had just told him that Scar had killed his father at anytime during his self-imposed exile (as opposed to the right at the end of the movie), **then Simba could've/would've just returned earlier, and the story resolves exactly the same way**â€”without need for Simba's wilderness/exile character development. Instead of a story about learning from your mistakes (which it has been building up to), then it becomes a story about *persevering to find the truth*.

Then, if it's not a story about learning from your mistakes, then what's the story about?â„¢ Where's the thematic resonance? Onto the one small change.

### (Not) Confessing crucial information

But first, a side note: it also sometimes breaks suspension of disbelief during the climax when Scar simply [gloats and reveals crucial information, when the smart villain would've just ended the hero right there](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe).

```screenplay
Scar savors the moment.

SCAR
And here's my little secret.
(whispering)
I killed Mufasa.
```

Why did Scar just admit to his own crime, and give Simba the moral high ground? Of course, it's in character and is the natural progression to the plot, and this is just me nitpicking the scene because I honestly don't find it that big a deal but might as well bring it up while on topicâ€¦ but this confession feels halfway to a [dues ex machina](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina).

In one simple villain mistake, all of Simba's problems and insecurities are resolved, and while there is still physical life-or-death tension in the battle, however, the intellectual thematic tension suddenly leaps to completion.

## The one small change: make Simba guilty

[The Secret to Writing Dynamic Characters: It's Always Their Fault - Helping Writers Become Authors](https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/secret-writing-dynamic-characters-always-fault/) is one of my favorite posts from the [Helping Writers Become Authors](https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com) blog that I <span style="text-decoration:underline;">always</span> find myself coming back to. Because, in every analysis, the discriminatory factor that makes or breaks a story, is almost always exactly this: **are the characters at fault?**

If there's one small change that I could make to The Lion King (perhaps it could've been in the live-action remake or stage musical adaptations) it would be this: **Simba's pride directly caused Mufasa's death.**

> If there's one small change that I could make to The Lion King, it would be this: **Simba's pride directly caused Mufasa's death.**

### Changing the terms of Mufasa's Death

Now earlier in the story, Scar tempts and lures Simba into the Elephant's Graveyard â€” but as manipulative as Scar is being here, we can still confidently say that Simba was completely at fault for letting his pride put himself at danger on this one.

```screenplay
SCAR
It's far too dangerous. Only the bravest of the lions go there.

SIMBA
(defensive)
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?
```

However, we can't really say the same for the next time when Scar doesn't tell Simba a single detail about the gorge, and Simba innocently sits there. He is the prey, and Scar is the predator. This is the scene we are going to make one small change to give Simba **agency**.

```screenplay
SEQ. 10 (STAMPEDE/MUFASA'S DEATH)
EXT. PLATEAU - THE FOLLOWING DAY

Two dots are down below in a tremendous gorge.

SCAR (O.S.)
Now you wait here. Your father has a marvelous surprise for you.

SIMBA (O.S.)
What is it?

EXT. FLOOR OF THE GORGE - A SHORT TIME LATER

Scar is with Simba under a tree. Simba sits on a rock.

SCAR
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise now, woudld it?

SIMBA
(sweetly shrewd)
If you tell me -- I'll still act surprised.

SCAR
(tsk-tsk-tsking)
You are such a naughty boy.

SIMBA
(man-to-man)
Come on, Uncle Scar...

SCAR
No-no-no. This is just for you and your dad. You know, a sort of father-son thing.
(a real pal)
Well, I'd better go get him.

SIMBA
I'll go with you!

SCAR
NO!
(sweetly)
No, no.

Scar starts to go.

SCAR
Just stay on this rock. You wouldn't want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas.
[...]
Now be a good lad and prove you can do one thing right: Stay on this rock and wait for your surprise.
```

One was temptation onto a guilty criminal, while the other was deception onto an innocent victim. Simba even tries to be culpable ("I'll still act surprised"), but Scar denies him any real accountability for what happens next. This earlier dialogue was surely (re)written and emphasized to go along with the climactic line: "You killed him! All this time, I hated myself -- when you're the one who did it!"

But as we discussed, I think it could be done better: let's make Simba guilty.

```screenplay

```

```screenplay-edited
SCAR
All right. I promised your father I wouldn't tell you!
(softens)
See that one young wilderbeest at the top of the gorge?

EXT. A LEDGE ABOVE

A lone, small-sized wildebeest grazes at the ravine's edge.

WITH SCAR AND SIMBA

SCAR (CONT'D)
I'll spook the poor thing, and he'll run towards you. Your father wanted to test your bravery, and see whether your roar will scare the beast away... whether your bravery was fit for a king.

SIMBA
(pouncing about excitedly)
Really?! My dad actually wants me to make me king!

SCAR
(honestly sarcastic)
Yes, because there's no other lion more worthy to rule.

SIMBA
(pauses)
Hey, but isn't this test dangerous? He said, being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble --

SCAR
Your father expects you to be a mighty king -- every knee of every animal will bow to you! Why, Simba, facing this frail animal will be the least of your future challenges! 
(sighing)
But you shouldn't be forced to do this dangerous test. I'll go tell your father that you aren't ready to be king.

Scar starts to leave.

SIMBA
Wait! No! I am ready!

SCAR
(turning back)
But what about your big mistake yesterday, with the hyenas? I think you should run away from becoming king, or you'll put someone else in danger again!

SIMBA
I'm bigger and braver now! I'll even take on TEN wildebeests!

SCAR
(pitifully)
Oh, Simba, if only I was half as brave as you! When your father comes, and you show him what a brave lion you are, he'll know *exactly* how worthy you are to become king.

Scar trots off. Simba centers himself on the rock, and waits.
```

`This rewritten scene is in contrast with the original scene above: Scar gives Simba an out, an option to escape the trap. But no, Simba's ego to want to be worthy of being king is the exact reason for his decision to stay in the gorge (instead of simply being tricked), and thus that his own ego is the reason why Mufasa dies. Scar still deceives Simba, but it's just a partial deception with Simba still mostly to blame, which Scar can/will use to leverage on Simba in the` [climactic scene](#changing-the-terms-of-the-climactic-revelation).

#### Brute-force vs. run-away

`I like that Scar emotionally blackmails Simba, how his rash attempts at proving himself really do put people in danger: first, it's Nala at the Elephant Graveyard. After this, it would be Mufasa really paying the price in the gorge.`

`Scar would play a win-win situation to Simba's insecurities, and this organically grew as I figured out what to write. See, Scar brings up the previous Elephant Graveyard incident (Simba's mistake) and presents Simba with` **`two choices: one, to brashly brute force succeeding the "test"/kingshipâ€”or, two to run away from the "test"/kingship`**. `Simba chooses to run headstrong into the "test" and force his way into becoming king, which allows Scar to attempt murder on Simba and Mufasa, and then assume the throne as sole heir.`

`But if Simba had chosen to run away from pursuing kingship and not do the "wildebeest test", then Scar could slowly whittle away at his confidence, until Simba is too afraid to ever take up the throne, leaving Scar the sole heir to the throne. Scar wins, either ways.`

#### Run-away vs. learn-from

As per the original script, what happens afterwards is that Mufasa sacrifices himself to save Simba from the stampede. **What happens is a mix of the two planned outcomes: Mufasa is murdered, but Scar can guilt trip Simba into leaving Pride Lands and giving up pursuit of the throne.**

In self-exile, Simba has discarded the brute-force-through-mistakes ideology, since it clearly didn't work, twice, and you can finally empathize why Simba is so confident towards Nala that you should just run away from every mistake and have no worries. In Simba's experience so far, facing mistakes always led to someone getting hurt, and Hakuna Matata was the only other alternative. Having Scar outright present this shallow A-or-B dichotomy to Simba is what holds Simba back from ever growing.

Raifiki later on would also present Simba (who now only knew of running) an A-or-B fork in the road. And Simba's tired of dichotomies. But Raifiki, he presents a third option: "You can either run from it, or *learn* from it."

Simba will be tested on how well understands learning from his mistakes, in the climax.

### Changing the terms of the climactic revelation

With Simba's guilt set up, we will also need to tweak the climactic dialogueâ€”though I'd say it still falls under the same change, these are just the consequential effects of the one change. But the climax is where the one small change will really shine.

Interestingly, I think it may be best to keep the original dialogue where Scar lets the cat out of the bag about how he murdered Mufasa. This is because Simba needs to somehow get closure and confirmation about Scar's involvement in Mufasa's death. And leading to a

```screenplay
SEQ. 19 (THE FIGHT)

EXT. PRIDE ROCK - DUSK

[...]

Simba's paw puts pressure on Scar's throat.

SCAR
(choking)
Alright! I did it.

SIMBA
(darkly)
So they can hear you.

```

```screenplay-edited
In Simba's blind rage, Scar manages to wrestle himself free. He climbs up onto a ledge. Loose rocks fall and prevent Simba from following suit.

SCAR
(announcing)
Simba wanted to show off to Mufasa how brave he was. So he went to a dangerous gorge known for its wilderbeest stampedes. 

Simba is stunned. What's Scar trying?

SCAR (CONT'D)
I tried to tell him it was too dangerous, but he wanted to take them on! I ran to warn Mufasa, who sacrificed himself to save Simba, because the spoilt crown prince just couldn't wait to be king.

SIMBA
I just was a child, Scar!

NALA
But it's true?

Is Mufasa dead, because of you?

SIMBA
(pause)

Nala backs away, in disgusted horror.

SCAR
Elephants and earmites, you heard it here first: Simba killed Mufasa.

The lionesses pounce into action at the words. A dozen hyenas pile onto Simba. A fight ensues.

```
