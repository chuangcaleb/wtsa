# Frozen II Rewrite – Screenplay

## F2R Screenplay

After discovering [Fountain – A markup language for screenwriting](https://fountain.io/), I needed a story to practice writing with. I also wanted to see the rewrite in screenplay format.

Starting on 30th May 2021, I started writing. I eventually set up a [linktree](https://linktr.ee/wtstorya) and kept it in Google Drive for contstant updates.

Now, with this website, I can just export it to HTML and locally link it here!

Again, like the [[Frozen II Rewrite – Beat Sheet#F2R Commentary|Frozen II Rewrite Commentary]], I stopped development at one point, and this one was because my studies were about to start again. Nevertheless, it is a very good writing experience that I learnt lots from and got to put into practice, and I hope to finish this screenplay format.
