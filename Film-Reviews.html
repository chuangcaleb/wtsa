<p>Watched it two weeks ago and posted a story review for it but I think it’s neater in the long run to have a post.</p>

<p>Another Disney live-action but a twist on the original story (and wow is this so different). I appreciate how they try to reinnovate the source material and dare to take a “mature” tone. Visuals were Disney-class stunning for sure. Certain moments certainly gripped my heart, and the characters presented are very complex.</p>

<h2 id="things-id-tweak-">Things I’d Tweak 🔧</h2>

<h3 id="1-elsas-arc">1. Elsa’s Arc</h3>

<p>Elsa has this inner conflict whether or not to answer this call but abandon her newfound family. After all, you can’t marry a man you just met. But she starts to say the throne is not where she belongs, fair enough. But then she starts drifting from Anna and from then on, she never had any doubts at all about going “alone and free”. All her conflict is just driven by Anna, but that doesn’t challenge her mind one bit.</p>

<p>So Elsa pushes Anna away and goes far away to an ice structure to discover who she really is, and pays the price for it. Sounds similar. Difference is, in F1, that’s the anti-lesson: that brings her further from her Need of “true love”. But in F2, Anna’s the antagonist for dissuading Elsa from achieving her destiny and if Elsa didn’t push her away and “go too deep”, then the curse would never be broken. It’s correct for Elsa to break her promise to stay together.</p>

<p><strong>Elsa’s arc is regressive and antithetical to the first movie</strong>. Female empowerment yay, but not at the cost at forgetting that the Frozen story has always been about the sisters coming “together”. Elsa longs for Anna more than anything in the world. That is the core of her character. Some things change, but must never contradict. Biggest gripe, because it’s so fundamental.</p>

<p>I’ve come up with an extremely simple tweak that completely recontextualises the entire story. <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">In Ahtohallan, instead of seeing their mom, Elsa could see memories of Anna.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Young Anna, teen Anna, adult Anna always there knocking at her door, Anna climbing up mountains for her, Anna giving up her life for her. Anna and Elsa are proof that magic and non-magic can coexist without fear but in true love. They succeed to love where King Runeard failed: they are Arendelle's second chance at redemption and reconciliation with Northuldria. Plus, since the Forest/Ahtohallan/whatever knows that Arendelle would be flooded if someone breaks the curse/dam, they bestowed Elsa with the power to hold the flood when the dam eventually must be broken.</code></p>

<h3 id="2-physical-antagonism">2. Physical Antagonism</h3>

<h4 id="2a-stakes-investment">2a. Stakes: Investment</h4>

<p><strong>Antagonism, or its force, is lacking in presence and in strength.</strong> Even though in F1, Hans was only revealed to be a villain towards the end, we still felt antagonistic force throughout the story with each rejection from Elsa, the world becoming winter and Anna’s frozen heart threatening to freeze her.</p>

<p>The elemental spirits presented an antagonistic force, but this movie is a case study of the weaknesses of forces of nature as antagonists. They felt too impersonal to the characters and too plot-heavy — attacks are coincidental, and they never develop throughout the story. The consequence of all this is that our protagonists don’t get challenged in the best ways possible.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, there <em>is</em> tension between the sisters (which is a little one-sided but ok), but the climactic fate of Arendelle could be handled better. For one, patriotism hasn’t been established to be a big thing, while personal stakes hit closer (as in F1). The audience doesn’t care if Arendelle lays in eternal winter or got flooded. The audience cares about individuals, that eternal winter means that Kristoff’s jobless, or that a frozen heart means Anna’s literally turning to ice, or that a flood means that the sisters will need to manage a kingdom without a land.</p>

<h4 id="2b-stakes-urgency">2b. Stakes: Urgency</h4>

<p>An antagonism shortcoming could be ascribed to a lack of urgency. I mean, Arendellians need a home, but how desperately? The dam needs to be broken, but why NOW? What’s the pressure? We call this the “or-else” factor: objective must be achieved before event or-else punishment.</p>

<p>A very simple fix is coined, “a ticking time-bomb”. In F1, the biggest example is Anna getting frozen in the heart: she must receive an act of true love before her hair goes all white <em>or else</em> she will freeze forever. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What if the "spirits" were dying due to the dam being built? Symbolically cause of injustice, and literally cause it holds back the water from the forest and restricting life. The curse must be lifted</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">before</code></em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">they grow too weak</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">or else</code></em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the the Forest becomes disenchanted (hah) and Elsa will be frozen (and Olaf will melt) cause she's a forest spirit. Just like that, there's so much pressure on both sides.</code></p>

<h4 id="2c-human-opposition">2c. Human Opposition</h4>

<p><strong>A physical villain/antagonist</strong> who embodied the idea of lies and selfish-nationalism would be great. He would be a great opposite-extreme villain to Hans, who represents danger when you open your doors too wide, versus someone who represents danger when you close your doors tight shut. Then came an amazing tweak that I read: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/12/02/the-5-biggest-problems-with-frozen-2/" class="web-link">a review article by Erik Kain</a> fantastically suggested, <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what if King Runeard survived?</code></strong></p>

<p>![[frozen-ii-erik-kain-review.png]]</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Imagine: the Forest trapped King Runeard and his men, and he wants a way out. The Northuldrians know to break the dam to break the curse. He tells his soldiers, the dam would flood Arendelle regardless of the wall of mist, so they've been guarding it. 30 years later comes our gang who meets both parties. It goes mostly the same way except King Runeard whispers to the gang that all this history is proof that magic is more dangerous than good, and why we should keep the past locked up in the past, then convincing them to keep things the same.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Later, King Runeard may find out his son married a Northulda; Elsa being a spawn of the "evil" Forest and the mist, Runeard commands his soldiers to kill her to break the curse. Mattias, the king's guard, has his loyalty and character tested. Runeard doesn't have to be another plot-twist villain; he could be obviously manipulative but spits real facts that, hey, Anna, you actually DIED last movie because of Elsa — are you really okay with that?</code></p>

<h3 id="3-kristoff">3. Kristoff</h3>

<p>Objectively, <strong>Kristoff’s subplot weighed the story down.</strong> I get where they were going that Kristoff’s love for Anna “is not that fragile”, and that his love never changes. But if you can cut a subplot, you cut it. It doesn’t really contribute. There was a lot of distracting and uncharacteristic dialogue and conflict for the sake of conflict between Anna and Kristoff. The proposal felt VERY out of place in the climax; it could be saved after her coronation.</p>

<p>But there’s other ways Kristoff can contribute; he’s such, such a complex character. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">He fits better with the Arendelle soldiers who are skeptical about magic, just as he was once skeptical about love. You could also meld Ryder with Mattias into one character: make them/him very stoic and distant at first, being the king's guard, like Kristoff initially was in F1. But Mattias loves reindeer too, and Kristoff can use that bond between man and reindeer to show Mattias his love for Anna, and by extension, the love Arendelle should have for Northuldria.</code></p>

<h3 id="4-deaths">4. Deaths</h3>

<p><strong>The deaths could have been set-up better.</strong> Olaf’s was okay, because from the very first movie it was a forefront problem that he melts under heat, and the false safety in the start of the second that Olaf now had permafrost. In fact, Olaf’s death gave good weight to Anna’s character. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Only suggestion is to show in the beginning when Elsa awakens the spirits, she could lose her powers for a moment — and Olaf could start to fade — but he recovers as her powers come back. Then there's the ever-looming threat and the setup where the audience knows, if Elsa dies then Olaf dies. That way, when Olaf's time comes, it's not as sudden.</code> But that’s no big deal.</p>

<p>What bothered me more was how Elsa’s death was (not) foreshadowed. You’ve got the “not too far or you’ll be drowned”, and a reminder again with Honeymaron about warnings. For others it’s okay, but in my first viewing, I didn’t get that complete emotional payoff. <em>Set-ups to deaths are like prophecies of doom.</em> First, all that can’t be the only foreshadowing for a major death. Second, if anything, it led me to believe she would drown in water.</p>

<p>I have to compare Elsa’s death with Anna’s death in the first movie: we knew Anna was always in danger of getting frozen™, and we’ve seen it nearly happened at the start of the movie when they were children. All throughout Frozen 1, we hear the trolls explain (to us) very specifically, twice. At least both deaths were fitting for their character arcs. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What if, for Elsa's death in Frozen II, the deeper Elsa went into Ahtohallan, the more she loses her magic (shown by how she can't make ice constructs anymore), and the more she paradoxically feels cold. If anything, it makes her sacrifice to find the truth even heavier because she gets to deliberate for a long time that she must pay the price for it.</code></p>

<h3 id="5-avatar-elsa">5. Avatar Elsa</h3>

<p>Nitpicking: <strong>the whole Avatar-Elsa-master-of-all-four-elements is not really touched on and is distracting at best</strong>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Just keep it simpla la and have only one water spirit because it relates to Elsa's ice and the whole water-is-memory and we see Elsa memory/water-bending and it makes sense. The other spirits can just be just normal Forest creatures who are angy. We still see the plot reveal of Elsa's-power-is-from-the-forest from a mile away — we don't need a hint that requires a whole I'm-the-fifth-element and other things to be part of the lore. We could still fit in a post credits where some girl in some other kingdom wakes up bending fire or smthn.</code></p>

<h2 id="things-i-liked-️">Things I Liked ❤️</h2>

<h3 id="1-matured-character-development">1. Matured Character Development</h3>

<p>One moment that hit me was near the start after Elsa walked out of charades and into her room; Anna knocked on her door and Elsa said “Come in,” which says a LOT, in the context of the first movie.</p>

<p>Our ever-optimistic Anna was broken down all the way to barebones and she’s tested for who she really is, and Olaf became “sadder and wiser”, finally going through what all snowmen have to.</p>

<p>They’ve learnt in the first movie how you can’t simply throw your heart around to anyone; they’ve learnt that love is free but comes at the greatest cost. Now they have to learn what happens when seasons change and all is lost.</p>

<h3 id="2-mature-and-dark">2. Mature and Dark</h3>

<p>I mean, don’t have grim for the sake of grim; but for a sequel whose predecessor was aimed at a young audience, they were willing to express mainly about loss and change and grief. Death of childhood figure (reminiscent of Bing Bong’s death from Inside Out) hit hard, that one. Olaf’s death was real, and meaningful. We jump from Anna cradling Olaf, to a wide shot of the forest, and then back to the cave, Anna’s arms now empty. That was good.</p>

<p>Then there’s war crimes and national secrets. on the one hand it feels a little too big-scale, but they do run a kingdom now.</p>

<h3 id="3-very-different-theme">3. Very Different Theme</h3>

<p>I was really confused at first at how <strong>different the themes</strong> of Frozen 1 line up with that of Frozen 2. I had many expectations and theories for sure, based off what has been established, like something about the <strong>theme of love vs. fear in family</strong>. Sequels need to develop the themes of the prior movie, with varying success across Kung Fu Panda, Toy Story, Wreck-it-Ralph, HTTYD, all the direct-to-video Disney films etc. Some stories just rehash the old theme with the same characyters going through the same character arcs. Other stories go off the opposite extreme deep end, cancelling out whatever they tried to say from the first movie.</p>

<p>But coming in, the first two songs set the tone and <strong>theme of change and truth in love</strong>. I had to drop everything I thought I knew (heh, which is what one of the movie’s messages) and just let myself enjoy the movie. Which was good, otherwise I would’ve been too intellectual all the way through.</p>

<p>And now in hindsight… the themes do relate strongly to the original, a development of he original, even — while still standing very apart on their own. I could never have predicted how it would develop. It’s not clear at first, but it’s a very tight, waterproof choice of theme.</p>

<h3 id="4-visuals">4. Visuals</h3>

<p>Interesting camera action/perspectives. The colours were really bold and vibrant. Orange landscape to contrast deep blue water and bright blue ice. Purple to represent fire, and also royalty. Costuming was a really nice change from the first movie too, which helped me to acclimatise to the new themes. There was this post on the significance of characters’ costuming, which was purposeful.</p>

<h3 id="5-musical-motifs">5. Musical motifs</h3>

<p>There were <strong>familiar musical and thematic motifs from the first movie</strong>, even if I wished they were more frequent and apparent. In just Some Things Never Change alone, you could hear parts of First Time in Forever (both songs mirror each other). The intro of Into The Unknown seems like a reordered and minor key-ed intro of Do You Want To Build A Snowman. Olaf melting, being frozen, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hThEIOeMTgM" class="web-link">Vuelie (From “Frozen”/Score)</a>. But this <strong>level of familiarity is probably a good thing was probably a conscious choice to not milk the nostalgia</strong> of the former hit as sequels are prone to do. They were similar but not repetitive. There was lots of new ground.</p>

<h3 id="6-self-awareness">6. Self-awareness</h3>

<p>Okay Olaf and his recaps and Samantha was pretty funny tbh. Other than Kristoff’s interactions with Anna, <strong>the movie’s comedy is great</strong>. A lot of self-referencing, which I enjoyed as a whole.</p>

				Mulan II – Film Review

<blockquote>
  <p>The flower that blooms in unity is the most honourable one of them all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>So I’ll be giving my thoughts on this movie <strong>from a pure story perspective</strong>: excluding Mushu being voiced by a white guy + the low budget animation (well, besides the grieving scene in the rain; but everywhere else, sheesh) + historical/cultural (in)accuracies.</p>

<p>“It’s just a cheap direct-to-video cashgrab,” UGH profits. But from a story POV, why should we lower the bar for sequels? (Especially when Kung Fu Panda 2 exists).</p>

<p>Of course, we must compare it with the first movie. There weren’t really any iconic plot beats. Reflection. Cutting her hair, slipping away in the rain. Climbing the pole. The decimated village. Ugh, Mulan I is so good. Not perfect, but great and iconic.</p>

<p>I think while it set some good groundwork, and was a fun ride, a lot was still lacking narrative-wise, especially in the intellectual thematic argument, which has so much to say.</p>

<h2 id="plot-summary">Plot Summary</h2>

<p>(since y’all probably never watched it, some never will, here it is)</p>

<h3 id="prose">Prose</h3>

<p>Shang proposes to Mulan. Mushu would lose his status as family guardian, as well as Mulan, so decides to break them up. The Emperor summons the duo to escort his three princess daughters to form an alliance with Lord Qin to protect them from a coming Mongol invasion. They recruit the Gang of Three (Yao, Ling and Chien-Po) from the first movie.</p>

<p>En route, the three princesses fall in love with the Gang of Three. Mushu causes trouble for Mulan’s r’ship, accidentally destroying their carriage/supplies. The guards and princesses sneak out and enjoy a festival at a village, while Mushu orchestrates Mulan and Shang into a heated argument.</p>

<p>Shang puts his foot down, forbidding the three pairs to talk, then mutually breaks up with Mulan. They get attacked by bandits and Shang sacrifices himself for Mulan.</p>

<p>Mulan grieves, then offers herself as bride instead of the princesses. Shang returns to crash the marriage. Mushu masquerades as the Great Dragon to dissuade Lord Qin, and weds the duo on the spot.</p>

<strong>Resolution</strong>: China is saved, due to the alliance. Mushu is added onto Shang’s family guardians, which means he still gets to be with Mulan.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-to-improve">What to improve</h2>

<h3 id="1-white-mushu">1. White Mushu</h3>

<p>Yea, discount Eddie Murphy was a hot mess. <strong>MulanII!Mushu was neither charismatic nor had his character explored enough</strong> to justify being conniving yet justify the audience’s sympathy, so he’s e just a bad bad guy. He’s just a plot device, it seems.</p>

<p>AND THEN when Mushu confesses what he’s done, and Mulan exclaims that Shang and her aren’t that different (this goes against <em>Lesson Number One</em>’s main message that differences are good). She then says all those problems weren’t because of themselves, but only because of Mushu (rip representation of a realistic couple working out their own flaws and differences, nope, if not for external forces, internally they are perfect, bro).</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Instead, we make</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mushu's arc a subplot about learning that there are circumstances where you must put duty over heart.</code></strong> WHAT?! Yes. One is not enough, we need both together. Mulan I was able to juggle advocating for the opposing themes of femininity vs masculinity.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What if</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mushu learns that if Mulan gets married, he won’t just lose guardianship; she’ll physically never see him again.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">He must wrestle to make the honourable choice to put his duty as guardian to Mulan’s happiness over his heart to be with her. He could be tempted to meddle with the couple once or twice, but it only causes some small trouble that by itself shouldn’t start a spark; but the couple escalates it on their own. And later, when Mushu confesses, Mulan recognises it’s their own fault.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">We could also make a bigger deal of Mushu being the one to wed them, because he’s effectively done his duty but lost his friend. If you want a gut punch, Mushu is consequently invisible to Mulan forever. Mulan shows her gratitude for the best guardian ever.</code></p>

<h3 id="2-emperors-army">2. Emperor’s Army</h3>

<p><strong>The Emperor doesn’t want to send his daughters, so why not just let his army fight instead?</strong> He was so wise in the first one… and looks like the fool now. “trust me, bro”. Apparently Mongols are not from this era irl, so <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let’s simply say the last remnants of the Huns are overrunning towns.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Our kingdom’s males-of-age have been too diminished from Shan Yu’s campaign from the last movie, and the Emperor didn’t want the couple worrying after their great victory. But now he’s desperate, desperate enough to send his own daughters.</code></p>

<h3 id="3-mulans-theme">3. Mulan’s theme</h3>

<p><strong>Mulan also suddenly goes off about arranged marriages</strong> when Mulan was literally preparing to be match-made in the first 5 minutes of Mulan I. Even had a song about it. It’s also literally the culture. But she needs to oppose this tradition, because we need to explain it to the audience, and she has to mentor the princesses. The first song shows Mulan understands that you must balance both heart and duty — then why’s she so imbalanced towards heart?</p>

<p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mulan doesn’t need to be so polar opposite to duty.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The princesses can craft and imply their own ideas. Shang may be the argument for</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extreme duty</code></em>,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">but since we already have so many arguments for</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extreme heart</code></em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">; let Mulan represent</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perfect balance</code></em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">but only seem to side with</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">heart</code></em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">when arguing and contrasting against Shang’s</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extreme duty.</code></em></p>

<h3 id="4-deadline">4. Deadline</h3>

<p><strong>We don’t feel the pressure of the Mongols and the deadline.</strong> They literally get mentioned once vaguely at the start, and never hear of them again. We don’t have that decimated village suckerpunch from Mulan I. We don’t see the <a href="https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/what-are-pinch-points-and-how-can-they-make-your-book-easier-to-write/" class="web-link">consequences</a> if they fail their mission, if they choose heart over duty. “Duty” doesn’t get to make a single case for itself, so it gets brutally whalloped by <em>Heart/Emotions</em>. Past the Midpoint when Princess Ting-Ting swaps sides, Shang is singled out and antagonised for sticking to honouring one’s duty, when that going-above-one’s-duty is a virtue that is praised in Mulan I.</p>

<p>The antagonists should appear earlier. Instead, we could have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hun spies catch wind of the marriage alliance. They send assassins to attack the gang at pinch points just when things get too lovey-dovey: the guards are punished for following their heart.</code></p>

<p>This would also make up for <strong>the boring lack of action set-pieces</strong>. It’s so… political and interpersonal. Not that that’s bad, but how can you have a plot about delivering a royal escort, with only one coincidental attack by random bandits throughout the entire runtime?! We also don’t get to see Mulan’s iconic tactical ingenuity and thinking outside-of-the-box.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Let the Emperor send an entourage. Let the Huns attack, and they cause the carriage runaway sequence. The gang might, I don’t know, fly across a gorge, isolating them from the entourage for the rest of the journey. Next, Mulan and Shang could be arguing while doing some sparring practice, and someone gets accidentally hurt, physically and emotionally.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The surprise attack would be by a pack of elite soldiers, who know the legend Fa Mulan who downed Shan Yu and their entire army. We get moments of genius from Mulan, to the amazement of the princesses. Shang and Mulan awkwardly avoid each other because they just argued.</code></p>

<h3 id="5-clunky-dialogue">5. Clunky Dialogue</h3>

<p><strong>Clunky dialogue. It’s hit-or-miss.</strong> For every “It’s not about his heart, it’s about mine,” there’s twenty “I have another duty… to my heart!”</p>

<p>“In an ideal world, not everyone can marry for love! But the world isn’t perfect. I’m just glad my world is.” Wow Shang really just said “rip to them but we’re different” AGHH <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I don’t know, just say “Their case is different than ours; the entire kingdom depends on their marriage.”</code></p>

<p>While I liked that we got to see a couple resolving an everyday argument and saying sorry, I didn’t like how they’re suddenly both sexist?? “What is it with men and asking directions?” “What is it with women and maps?” At least make it sexist according to Chinese culture lol. And, if they apologise for that, that means they should affirm these toxic stereotypes.</p>

<pre><code class="language-screenplay-edited">SHANG
My father raised me as a soldier since I was a boy. You should trust my expert experience.

MULAN
The map is too ruined. You should consider your fiance’s advice.
</code></pre>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shang can even say something terrible, but cultural, like, “Did they even teach you anything in those rural schools?” but later regrets and acknowledges that’s out of line.</code></p>

<h3 id="6-anticlimactic-climax">6. Anticlimactic climax</h3>

<p><strong>The climax flopped.</strong> Mushu saves the day in a deus ex machina, the cardinal sin. Why did the princesses/guards even need to be there for, besides showing face? Mulan just kinda stood there. Shang throws a Japanese shuriken. Here’s a quick rewrite: (hah)</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Quick cuts of Shang, the princesses/guards and Hun assassins sneaking into the palace, knocking out the local guards, so there’s no one else to the rescue. When Shang crashes the wedding, the Huns spring into action, scattering everyone. Mulan and her handmaidens are backed up into a corner, hopelessly outnumbered, when they reveal to be the soldier trio in makeup disguise! Shang and the princesses disguised as soldiers protect the princes, who show their true colours as spoiled brats in front of the princesses.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">More fighting; Mushu wants to light a signal fire for help. He only puffs a small flame, then the soldier trio fan it so hard that it almost dies. The princesses step in and fan it gently, growing into a huge fire. Support arrives, rounding up the rest of the Huns. Emperor Qin honours the alliance without needing marriage.</code></p>

<h3 id="7-the-clown-prince">7. The Clown Prince</h3>

<p>Why is the foreign crown prince portrayed so dumb; I thought we decided with the soldier trio that we shouldn’t shame weird people. lol. Then the dad/Emperor just forgets about the whole alliance thing and plays with the chinese finger trap. bruh??? No thoughts, head empty.</p>

<h3 id="8-resolution">8. Resolution</h3>

<p><strong>There was no plot resolution.</strong> What happened to the alliance/the invasion?<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Since the Huns would’ve wiped all China, Mulan saved the Northern Kingdom too, but they did not reciprocate dutifully. Mulan could give some speech about dishonour, and the other Emperor would be ashamed, and agree to the alliance without the marriages.</code></p>

<p>What are the consequences of the princesses getting with lowly guards? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The guards could be sentenced to execution for treason (just like how in the first movie, Shang sentenced Mulan to death when he found out she was a woman), but the princesses step in gracefully, explaining their honour. They then offer to give up their royalty ties, and live as nobodies, but with their loves. yay</code></p>

<h2 id="what-i-liked">What I liked</h2>

<h3 id="1-princesses-as-main-characters">1. Princesses as main characters</h3>

<p>Giving <strong>the princesses</strong> some spotlight instead of Mulan. I like that it doesn’t try to force Mulan into a positive arc. Mulan <em>works</em> as a flat arc character, and it’s great to see her as a mentor to the princesses. We also see the flip side of the glamour of Disney princesses, and it ties well into Mulan’s themes: their responsibility to the kingdom. It’s not all glitter and princes: especially in Imperial China. It sets up a good conflict.</p>

<h3 id="2-songs">2. Songs</h3>

<p><strong>The two (2) songs bop.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Lesson Number One</em></strong> is Mulan teaching little girls that you can/should/must be strong AND gentle. It’s to the tune/style of honour to Us All with the training montage feel of Be A Man. All songs have lyrics about who “You must be…”, and it finally comes to a climax in this song. Would’ve been nice in the bridge, to see the girls trying to exaggerate being rough to imitate masculinity, but Mulan corrects them.</p>

<p><strong><em>Like Other Girls</em></strong> isn’t a song about them just wanting to run away with the guards; they want to escape the walls of their palace, a la Jasmine in Aladdin. It’s clear from the “It’s not about his heart, it’s about mine,” line that this goes deeper than just another romance song. (Yes, the “Like holding a lily” part is low-key racist, t’was a bad attempt at making a Western tone feel Chinese. Just keep it Western.)</p>

<h3 id="3-the-third-act-twist">3. The third act twist</h3>

<p>The third act twist: Mulan takes the princess’ place in arranged marriage. <strong>It is a stark reflection of how Mulan took her father’s place in the conscription, but in reverse</strong>, not going to war as a man, but to marriage as a woman. Again, Mulan makes the heroic, honourable choice of sacrificing her life, but in a subversive way.</p>

<p>“This is Fa Mulan, the hero who saved China! She is worth more than three princesses!” No matter how much Mulan excelled at being the stereotypical heroic male war hero, she was still treated just as a trophy wife.</p>

<p>Seems like just three points, but they are three very strong points.</p>

<hr>

<p>LOL so I watched a video where they talked about the cultural aspect of this movie. In the climax, Shang interrupts the wedding seal by throwing a <em>shuriken</em>. A Japanese shuriken. From a Chinese setting. hahahahahahahahha</p>

<h2 id="five-things-id-tweak-">Five Things I’d Tweak 🔧</h2>

<h3 id="1-inappropriate-climactic-music">1. Inappropriate climactic music</h3>

<p>Only had one real problem with the show: the playful, <strong>comedic background music in the serious climax</strong> after Maleficent freezes everyone. It’s the final showdown between protagonist and antagonist, but it really kills the mood and makes the stakes feel trivial. It’s not a scriptwriting problem: the dialogue was true, but wow was the music jarring. Which is weird, because musical themes in background music everywhere else were on point.</p>

<h3 id="2-mals-other-sketches">2. Mal’s other sketches</h3>

<p>Mal is an artist. We see her spray paint everything and compulsively draw sketches of the Magic Wand in her sketchbook. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What if, after her date with Ben, she flips her sketchbook and</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">starts drawing sketches of Ben instead</code></strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">literally turning over a new page. And then later after the Family Day feud disaster, she can rip off and crumple her sketch of Ben, returning to the Magic Wand sketch and her old self. And then before the climax as she makes the Anti-Love potion, she can uncrumple the sketches of Ben beside her, illustrating to the audience of her inner conflict and his impact on her.</code></p>

<h3 id="3-jays-character-arc">3. Jay’s character arc</h3>

<p>“And he likes to hurt people!” was Chad’s accusation of Jay, but no one got seriously hurt. Chad once mentioned off-handedly that his phone was stolen, but I don’t think stealing was really Jafar’s thing either, <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I think Jay’s most resonant arc would’ve been pride in self vs. humility in teamwork</code>.</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jafar himself couldn’t accept being number two. Jay would start off muscle-ing the rest of the gang: if he could get the Wand before Mal, his father could one-up Maleficent. This is why he hastily trips the alarm in the museum. At his first time on the tourney field, Coach tells him that he would’ve scored without fouls if only he had passed the ball. At the 50% mark in the big match against the rivals, in the last seconds, Chad is in the clear, but Jay selfishly hesitates, but then Chad gets marked, so Jay passes to Ben to make the winning shot. Chad was so close at being the winning scorer, and later this is what Chad accuses him of on Family Day: “Jay is after Ben’s role as team captain! What next, Auradon?!”</code></p>

<h3 id="4-closer-character-climaxes">4. Closer character climaxes</h3>

<p>In the climax, the gang put their fists-in-a-ring thing, and choose good, resolving their internal arcs there. Then later, Maleficent comes, we have the back and forth, then final battle, resolving their external arcs there much later. <strong>Resonance is amplified when as many arcs climax as close to each other as possible</strong>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">like constructive interference. After Mal chooses to be good because of Ben, she can still make her speech, but the gang don’t look fully convinced. Then her mother crashes in, but the gang doesn’t back Mal from the beginning.</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Only when the battle starts, then the gang step into action one-by-one,</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">so the audience, together with Mal, get this climax at the most important last moment possible.</code></p>

<h3 id="5-audreys-character-arc">5. Audrey’s character arc</h3>

<p>Not sure what to think of <strong>Audrey’s arc</strong>. Chad’s right: Mal stole Audrey’s boyfriend, who she seems to be happy with. Furthermore, her grandma would know that Mal ruined Audrey’s relationship with the heir to the throne. And in the Resolution, Mal steals Audrey’s place for the throne, and Audrey just curtsies away? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">But: what if Audrey and Ben were in an incompatible relationship? And when Ben reveals his facade to Mal at the coronation, he also says that after the love potion wore off on their first date, he immediately formally broke up with Audrey (so he never did Audrey any wrong). He’s still the only one who knows of the love potion: Ben acknowledges that Mal was still 100% in the wrong for it—but he plays along, because he believed in Mal, that she would do the right thing somehow, and she does. In the Resolution, Mal should apologise to Audrey, and Audrey can also sympathise Mal’s hardships (while not excusing her actions) and admit that the relationship wasn’t working anyways.</code></p>

<h2 id="five-things-i-liked-️">Five Things I Liked ❤️</h2>

<h3 id="1-evil-queen">1. Evil Queen</h3>

<p><strong>Evil Queen.</strong> An icon. A good quirky, not downright weird like Cruella. Little dialogue but she really made the most of it.</p>

<h3 id="2-evies-arc">2. Evie’s arc</h3>

<p><strong>Evie’s arc</strong> sends a really healthy message, too. Being the daughter of the Evil Queen who sought to be the prettiest, she starts off chasing after princes, vanity and her own looks, but ends up admiring simple Doug. And I’m glad that it wasn’t just a, “Oh, now you’re with Doug, you’ve found a partner and that solves all your self-esteem issues,” no—Mal affirms everything Evie already is, is already enough, so no need to keep chasing for more.</p>

<h3 id="3-love-potion">3. Love potion</h3>

<p>I thought, wouldn’t it be cool if <strong>the love potion didn’t work and Ben was faking it somehow</strong>? Then in the pre-climax, Ben reveals it wore off early on. I called it. This makes great story, because <strong>one</strong>: Ben is your standard, gentle, harmless paragon. The whole goody-two-shoes routine gets boring. But tbf (even better) it’s also broken up by his wild musical number at the 50% Midpoint. And <strong>two</strong>: in the climax, Ben has to be fully conscious to play his role as the paragon in truly believing in Mal when it matters the most. So, how to remove the love potion’s effects without him feeling betrayed by and losing faith in Mal? Reveal: the love potion wore off, and he’s been faking it.</p>

<p>This solution makes his character so more complex: he knows Mal’s nature to be malicious, yet plays along because he believes the good choice in her is stronger than her bad nature. Plus, he becomes more than just a naive king as even the main characters assume—<strong>he’s cunning, yet wise, and big-hearted</strong>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Though there could be more foreshadowing when the magic is supposedly washed away in the Enchanted Lake. Coming out of the water, he could have a confused expression, as he pieces it all together... but then considers how Mal just risked drowning to save his life, and we see the moment he plans and decides to play along, and act all lovey-dovey again.</code></p>

<h3 id="4-showing-character-arcs-not-telling">4. Showing character arcs, not telling</h3>

<p>On the night before the coronation, three of the gang have physical items representing the Truth that it’s possible for them to be happy while living contrary to their evil nature: the trophy; Dude the Dog; the B+ report. It’s always visually impactful to see <strong>physical manifestations of their character arcs</strong>. Mal gets nothing, though. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">So besides my addition of the sketch of Ben, she could also mull over that glowing wish ball that Ben gave her at the lake.</code></p>

<h3 id="5-janes-place-in-the-plot">5. Jane’s place in the plot</h3>

<p>It was interesting reveal that Jane (Fairy Godmother’s daughter) was the one who breaks the barrier with the Wand and sets off the climax. Having Mal suddenly double back on her character development and actually break the barrier would make things unnecessarily complicated, since she’s already on an upwards character arc after doing one or two double-backs. <strong>Jane also fulfills the example of the reverse argument</strong>: a child of a “good” parent making “evil”/selfish choices, proving again the Truth of this story that our nature is not our identity.</p>

<hr>

<p>So it turns out living overseas by yourself is tougher than it looks. It’s exactly two months today, in fact. I’ve had three entire posts written out because I knew I was gonna be busy, but WOW I’ve not had time to even think about writing.</p>

<p>It’s smack-middle of the semester now. Yea I also found out dissertations are no joke. So I’m going to be busy with that. Plus my social life, I’m barely attending one society, and barely getting time for friends back home, and barely networking out of the same old South East Asian people. It’s terrible lol</p>

<p>One good news. My flatmates and I have decided to order a 61-key MIDI keyboard to share. I’ve been wanting to properly pick it up for forever. Hopefully I can learn some more skills, and I’m purposely looking into the musical side of storytelling.</p>

<p>I’ll just post whenever there’s time but ugh it just takes so long to materialise thoughts into a document like this, and then package it into screenshots for Instagram. Hope to find friends here who can walk this road with me.</p>

<h2 id="initial-comments">Initial Comments</h2>

<p><strong>Production went wrong somewhere</strong>.</p>

<p>Strike one, a weird sequence of events: when Mal returns to the Island for the first time, she goes straight to her house. One scene later she’s downstairs getting a hairdo at Tremaine’s as if that was her first stop—then she’s suddenly back in her house again. Watching the editing there feels… off. Like a last minute edit to the script and blocking.</p>

<p>Strike two: Chad kept letting loose about usurping Ben for the King to impress Audrey. He even catches on that Ben was kidnapped and was told not to tell anyone, but that setup never got resolved. And then he was never to be seen again. Wikipedia says that Audrey’s actress was not involved in this movie, but the script awkwardly left traces of her character.</p>

<p>Strike three: as Mal was packing to run away, she takes back her mother, lizard!Maleficent, in a box with holes. But that’s never revisited again. What happens?!?! Apparently a spin-off book explains strikes two and three, but the in-story movie itself feels weird, and Chekov’s gun, y’know.</p>

<h2 id="things-id-tweak-">Things I’d Tweak 🔧</h2>

<h3 id="1-pacing-and-songs">1. Pacing and songs</h3>

<p>Foremostly, the <strong>movie’s pacing is a mess</strong>. The four Acts were so unevenly split: 35-10-35-20 when it should be closely split 25-25-25-25 over about a 100 minutes’ runtime. A whole lot of the First Act was a mess. Many songs don’t develop the story.</p>

<h4 id="1a-ways-to-be-wicked">1a. Ways to be Wicked</h4>

<p><strong><em>Ways to be Wicked</em></strong> is literally an outtake song from the first movie that lost to <em>Rotten to the Core</em>: you can tell, the bridge goes “Mother always knows best (also, that Tangled reference)” and “Hear her voice in my head”, which I liked, though “rotten to the core” is a more fitting theme overall. But it’s such a weird choice as an opening song for the second movie, because the first 5 minutes does nothing for the story when it’s revealed: it was all a dream. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Instead, start in the real world, with one of those ensemble songs to introduce everyone’s plot goals, centred around preparing for the Catalion.</code></p>

<h4 id="1b-the-space-between">1b. The Space Between</h4>

<p><strong><em>The Space Between</em></strong> was kind of a directionless song, and seems like an imitation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8YMfgu92hQ" class="web-link">For Good (From “Wicked” Original Broadway Cast Recording/2003) - YouTube</a>. ‘Cause, while it was somewhat appropriate to their character arcs so far: absolutely nothing <em>changes</em> about the story through and after the song. And that’s because by being so cordial, the song effectively <em>sidesteps conflict</em> instead of <em>tackling conflict</em> — conflict is the engine of a story.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Let’s flip the song on its head, calling it:</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">No Space Between</code></em>. As per the original plot, Evie wants to convince Mal to stay with her in Auradon, but instead it turns out: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mal also wants Evie to stay with her on the Isle. They both realise how unlimited they can be together, which makes it even more tragic when they sing and realise that there’s “no space between” the Isle and Auradon: it’s one or the other. That’s the theme of the story. They start to argue, escalating dramatically until Mal steps too far and magicks Evie. The song ends the same with the two disagreeing, but now it’s more tragic. They don’t even need to reunite right away upon learning Ben was kidnapped. Draw it out long.</code></p>

<p>I discuss <em>What’s My Name?</em> later.</p>

<h3 id="2-jay--carlos">2. Jay &amp; Carlos</h3>

<p>I feel like <strong>they didn’t know what to do with Jay and Carlos</strong>. Jay’s arc would’ve made sense with my Descendants 1 rewrite where Jay was more like Jafar, hating to be number two—giving up captainship to someone else means a lot more, showing he’s really not the person he used to be. Carlos (and Jane) was sidelined to a lame asking-a-girl-out subplot.</p>

<p>Credit due, Carlos proved to be the heart of the group as they said he was, getting everyone into that heart-to-heart. Then Jay offered to drive Mal back. Nice, but <strong>we need more plot threads as to why Jay and Carlos HAD to be on the mission in the first place</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perhaps only Jay knew how to drive a car, plus he was good muscle.</code></p>

<h3 id="3-remembering-janes-arc">3. Remembering Jane’s arc</h3>

<p>Welp, we spent the last movie exploring Jane, how she wanted a cooler hairstyle to become popular and accepted, and how <strong>Jane’s thinking was superficial and skin deep</strong>. But in this movie, without explanation, she has stylish hair now, plus she’s suddenly more confident and Carlos suddenly digs her. Is it because of who she’s become on the inside? Or is it because of how she <em>looks</em> on the outside? It’s never explored, and this does a 180º on a really good message from the first movie. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">So yes. Either keep Jane’s old hair, or maybe have some plot event temporarily ruins her hair, but show Carlos and Jane not caring.</code></p>

<h3 id="4-bringing-back-the-parents">4. Bringing back the parents</h3>

<p>So the gang made an off-remark about returning to the Island: “Stay low, I hope we don’t bump into our parents!” which is a shame because if not for Kristen Chennowyth’s casting expenses, <strong>the parents’ appearances would be a great <a href="https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/improve-your-character-instantly-just/" class="web-link">Ghost</a></strong> to haunt the kids.</p>

<p><strong>What if</strong> when Ben gets captured, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">they are forced to meet their parents to get some resources from them to get Ben back—perhaps components for a 3D printer so that they don’t have to awkwardly travel back to Auradon, and back again. Even if not the parents, they could bump into their lackeys, extensions of their antagonism. They would marvel at how much their children individually changed and how much they’re not “of the Island” anymore, further proving their growth.</code></p>

<h3 id="5-ben-gets-himself-kidnapped">5. Ben gets himself kidnapped</h3>

<p>So <strong>Ben just wanders off and gets kidnapped</strong> somehow while Evie speaks to Mal, and none of the guys took notice. Wat. Coincidences makes not a good story. <a href="https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/secret-writing-dynamic-characters-always-fault/" class="web-link">Always blame your characters.</a> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What if the pirate gang ambushes our gang, turning into a street chase where they have to split up? Our gang are hesitant to knock over stalls to get ahead because they’re good now (in blinding contrast to their intro song, Rotten to the Core), but because the pirates don’t care, they catch up to them. At one point, Ben chooses to save a kid in danger, and this gets him caught.</code></p>

<h3 id="6-the-perfect-auradon-girl">6. The perfect Auradon girl</h3>

<p>At the start, Mal always says “I’m not an Auradon girl,” but wouldn’t it be great if perhaps <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">in an interview, Mal messes up and Audrey steps in to save the day, and the interviewers swarm Audrey instead and she handles the limelight well. Even unintentionally,</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Audrey is the paragon of a “perfect Auradon girl”.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">During the picnic argument, Mal brings this up to Ben and he replies, “I’m not looking for a perfect Auradon girl. I’m looking for you.”</code></p>

<p>I call it The Audrey Rewrite. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mal would frequently mention or imply Audrey when asserting that she’s not *good*. Even as a passive background character,</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Audrey’s existence actively reminds Mal of who she can never be, leading Mal to realise who she already is, who always has been and always will be.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">It would also be interesting in the climax to see Audrey quickly realising what’s happening when Ben gets bewitched by Uma, because that’s what Mal did in the first movie. And then her weird mixed feelings towards Mal: some sympathy, some unearthed hurt from the past.</code></p>

<h3 id="7-arm-wrestling-with-stakes">7. Arm wrestling with stakes</h3>

<p><strong>The arm wrestling scene</strong> didn’t really do much as the Midpoint. We see their rivalry, some banter, but nothing more. Consider this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mal walks in. They squabble because their mothers were rival leaders of territories, too.</code> Granted, it was a nice detail that Uma makes a deal, like Ursula did/does. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">But she could make a more interesting deal: If Uma wins, she gets the Wand. If Mal wins, she also gets Ursula’s magic seashell, making Mal effectively the most powerful person on the Isle, winning Ursula’s half of the Isle for her mother, besides cementing Mal’s decision to stay on the Isle.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">They arm wrestle to the death, and where Mal’s eyes glow green, Uma’s seashell glows teal. Starting to lose, Uma taunts Mal that she knows that Mal used a love potion on Ben, how Mal is ruthless and evil and really belongs to the island as much as Uma doesn’t want her to stay. As much as Uma, Mal, Ben, anyone denies it: Mal was an Island girl through and through. Mal slowly breaks and suddenly spurts out that she loves them both equally—a catharsis that makes her lose focus and the arm wrestle. Mal loses the fight; but she realises the Midpoint truth: she is both Island and Auradon.</code></p>

<h2 id="things-i-liked-️">Things I Liked ❤️</h2>

<h3 id="1-complex-evie">1. Complex Evie</h3>

<p>Again, <strong>Evie is my favourite character</strong>. She gets a great parallel arc with Mal. She has really great chemistry with Ben and Dizzy. I liked the part where she catches the kids stealing her wallet—but then decides to let them keep it, compassionate heartbreak across her face. It’s complex: on one hand, she’s kind-hearted now—an Island-girl-no-more; but, she’s also got a large place in her heart for the people of her Island. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">But let’s up the ante.</code> <em>Chilling Like a Villain</em> doesn’t do anything story-wise, because Ben never got a chance to feign his true self as Evie had warned him to—and Gil coincidentally bumps into them.</p>

<p>What if we rearrange the events so that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the stealing kids come right after Carlos and Jay hush them because a curious crowd is forming as kindness isn’t local behaviour. As the crowd starts to recognise the daughter of the Evil Queen, Evie chooses to let the kids go, furthermore letting them keep the money, and consequently exposes the gang: ironically, Ben wouldn’t be the one to crack, but Evie would. This would be Evie’s characteristic catharsis. Gil is part of the crowd that forms, exposing the gang to Uma, giving plot consequences to Evi'e characteristic moment. Beautiful.</code> I also think that there’s potential contrast between small, nerdy Doug v.s. big, jockish Gil. Especially when Evie’s mom was all about the “fairest of them all” while Gaston was “a perfect, a pure paragon”!</p>

<h3 id="2-ben-the-paragon">2. Ben, the Paragon</h3>

<p>They also did <strong>Ben good as the paragon</strong> of all things sunshine. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Might’ve used a little more setup for him losing his temper at the picnic.</code> But he had good reason to. It was good to put Mr. Perfect in unfamiliar shoes: blending in with the Island; in the climax, bewitching him to creepily ignore Mal. This works well because it is in such contrast with moments where he basically was ready to die for the good he believed in. He has the same climax as the first movie of bargaining with a conflicted kid from the Isle from going too far—but that’s what he’s all about, and it works.</p>

<h3 id="3-uma-eventually">3. Uma, eventually</h3>

<h4 id="umas-chemistry-with-ben">Uma’s chemistry with Ben</h4>

<p>Uma started off boring. The first scene and introduction song <em>What’s My Name?</em> was out of place — she expresses her character wants but has no plot goals yet. She doesn’t need to appear in the story yet.</p>

<p>But in the end I liked <strong>Uma’s chemistry with Ben</strong> on the ship, showing just a glimmer of her tragic innocence, and how she’s somewhat redeemable: this makes her sudden appearance in the Final Act not be completely out of the left field. It’s also really apt how she, like Ursula, used magic to make the guy fall in love with her.</p>

<h4 id="whats-my-name">What’s My Name?</h4>

<p>What if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">we cut that introductory scene in the First Act completely.</code> Fast forward to the Second Act, a kidnapped Ben is brought to her and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meets her for the first time along with the audience. Ben would legitimately ask who she is.</code> Then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">only now does</code> Uma sing <em>What’s My Name?</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">to introduce herself to Ben (and the audience).</code> This is great, especially since even in the original story, Uma complained how she was forgotten by the King of Auradon. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">This relocated scene should not take place in the bar/den or on the ship, since there are already other important set pieces in those locations already (the arm-wrestling scene and the swordfight scene), besides also being chronologically closeby.</code> The scene can just end with Uma’s original dialogue with Ben.</p>

<h3 id="4-harry-hooks-actor">4. Harry Hook’s actor</h3>

<p><strong>Harry Hook</strong> is played so wildly and eccentrically. He perfectly fills the role of the kid who was born on the Island and made the choice to be evil—contrasted with Uma at the pirate ship as she scolds him for pushing Ben nearer off the plank. While both have made bad choices, there’s an important distinction between Uma and Harry. Straightforward, fun and resonant—it works. He doesn’t need redemption, he’s just evil through and through. I’m mad he doesn’t have a bigger role in the story nor the finale.</p>

<p>What if, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">after Uma’s deception is revealed in the finale, Harry and Gil appear with a pirate ship as violent plan B—they too had escaped the dome with Uma. A whole CGI battle ensues where Evie, Carlos and Jay get to fight a bit… Then in the climax, Ben convinces Uma to surrender and she retreats, dragging the pirate ship back with her. More action.</code>Also, how’s she supposed to go back into the dome now that it’s closed again? It’s explained in the sequel movie but even so, uhhh?? <em>So I’ve been informed that this was addressed in the third instalment. Cool.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Just submitted my interim report for my final year dissertation. I got to learn LaTeX, and got this Latex Workshop extension for VS Code. Recommend, I can’t imagine doing LaTeX on anything other than VS Code.</p>

<p>I feel like this year is going to be a repeat of last year around this time, just busy busy busy with academics and barely getting any writing output over this semester. I’m so behind with work for next semester, too.</p>

<p>But we (with my flatmates) (impulse) bought a MIDI keyboard! I’m on day 3 of at least 30 minutes of practice a day. Hopefully this improves my writing, from a musical perspective!</p>

<p>Anyways. Merry Christmas!</p>
