                        Disney’s Raya – Cultural Review
                    </a>

                    <!-- 
        

<p>In line with Hari Raya weekend here in Malaysia, here’s my thoughts on Disney’s Raya and the Last Dragon. I originally intended to do a TV Series Pitch, as many agree it would’ve been better as an episodic format, like Avatar: The Last Airbender.</p>

<p>But I started writing and writing and found it turned into a 5.5k+ words commentary on the <strong>cultural consistency of Raya</strong>. Which is interesting, because I am all about that story and narrative and usually leave other production elements like cinematography and soundtrack in the footnotes. However, story narrative doesn’t live in a vacuum: some of my favorite narrative scenes are framed by excellent visual composition and a heart-thumping musical theme.</p>

<p>And perhaps it’s because it’s supposedly inspired by my own SEA (Southeast-Asian) culture, which should be familiar to my mind and resonate close to my heart. I found myself having many things to say, on culture of all things. ‘Cause I *really* don’t consider myself a patriotic and culturally-attuned fellow. Perhaps that will make itself clear as you read on HAHAHA please take my words with a bowl of salt.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>🚨 <strong>Spoiler Alert!</strong> 🚨 Everything that follows is spoiler territory, obviously…</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="inconsistent-anatopismanachronism-with-sea-culture">Inconsistent Anatopism/Anachronism with SEA Culture</h2>

<p>Worldbuiling writers use real-world cultures to inspire their fictional world, but even unintentional correlation will appear and are assumed intentional on the audience’s end (“Yea, I totally planned that deep triple-subtext!”).</p>

<p>But there are varying degrees to adopt and mix-in real-world cultures into a custom world. What strategy does Raya use? Let’s look at examples throughout the movie:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They do mention real-life local fruits like <em>jackfruit</em>, the chain-sword is clearly based on the <em>keris</em>, and the world is obviously based off SEA more than any other region.</li>
  <li>We’ve got psuedo-words like <em>binturi</em> and <em>Kumandra</em>, and lots of the cultures, while it doesn’t exist in real life, it’s enough to fool most people to be SEA-like.</li>
  <li>Then we’ve got polar opposite climates (deserts and snow) and anatopistic dialogue (“Flaming catapults!”), and animals that simply just aren’t from SEA at all.</li>
</ol>

<p>It feels like they’re deliberately trying to create a new and different culture only <em>inspired</em> by SEA. <strong>But the worldbuilding is too different to be considered Southeast Asian, whilst being too Southeast Asian to be considered something different.</strong> There’s just too much stuff from Point 3 that clashes discordantly for the story to brand itself as Point 1. The new non-SEA fictional elements aren’t fleshy/fleshed out enough to stand together with the real-life SEA elements, especially in a short movie. I think it would’ve been so amazing for Raya to just lean completely into SEA culture—or at least to squirm away from whatever clashes with it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Raya seems to be unsure of its identity and where it stood. I found this term to be aptly descriptive of Raya: <strong>Anatopism</strong> (from the Ancient Greek ἀνά, “against,” and τόπος, “place”) is something that is out of its proper place; a geographical misplacement. You may see it referred to <em>anachorism</em> (not to be confused with <em>anachronism</em>). (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatopism" class="web-link">Anatopism - Wikipedia</a> )</p>

<h3 id="sea-names-word-choices-personality">SEA Names, Word Choices, Personality</h3>

<p>Names are where it really breaks suspension of disbelief for me.</p>

<p>“Naamari” sounds too African when Fang is Angkor-Wat-inspired (Cambodian). While “Raya” is peak Indo-Malaysian—her father’s name, “Benja”, is very European. Some Kumandran would’ve had to have coined the double U’s in “Druun”, but there’s just no such “uu” spelling/phoenetic(?) anywhere remotely in Asia. <strong>Same symptom of the <em>it’s-SEA-culture!-but-not-really!</em> thing.</strong> I’m all for have cultural <em>diversity</em>, sure, but there’s no cultural <em>consistency</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve just read on <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Water_Tribe" class="web-link">Water Tribe | Avatar Wiki | Fandom</a> that <em>the names of the [Water] Tribes’ citizens often include one or two “K”s and have an “AH” sound (Katara, Hakoda, Sokka, Pakku, Kya, Kanna, Arnook, Korra, Tarrlok, Yakone, Noatak, Eska, Varrick etc.)</em>. Notice how none of the names sound Oriental or Western. Even if (and especially when) not coupled with the original culture, this is just one example how some level of <em>consistency</em> and pattern made ATLA’s inspired fictional cultures feel so realistic to their world. This is the gold standard here.

<pre><code class="language-screenplay">TONG
And you will be reunited with your family, Noi.

RAYA
Um, what did you just call her?

TONG
Noi. It’s her name. It’s written on her collar. Have none of you ever checked?

Everyone is guilty.

TONG (CONT'D)
And they think of me as the ruffian.
</code></pre>

<p>Talon tribe’s Con-Baby Noi is named as “Little Noi” in the credits, which I assume is meant to be “Xiao(小/Little) Noi”, which adds so much intimacy. but Tong just calls her by her first name like a Western person (in the East, it’s a capital crime).</p>

<p>In a similar vein, at one point the script has Tong say “ruffian”. They might as well say “mafia” or “gangster”. And the “Jerky” in “Jackfruit Jerky” is too Western. Just say “dried jackfruit”. Even in Mulan or Aladdin, Mushu and Genie gets the pass only because they’re magical beings, and it’s only ever one character i.e. the exception.</p>

<p>A lot more choice words could’ve been used and transliterated, like <em>Kumandran laksa</em> (in place of the “Kumandran Stew”) or <em>nangka</em> in place of dRieD jAcKfRuiT, or some character facepalming and going “<em>Aduhai! Budak ‘ni.</em>” Cultural idioms/proverbs like <em>nasi sudah menjadi bubur</em>—even when said aloud in directly-translated English, “[the] rice already turned into porridge”—is way better and more appropriate than if someone were to say, “no use crying over spilt milk”. These are some examples from one Malaysian, but I’m sure Disney can afford a team of SEA culture experts to seize these opportunities plenty.</p>

<h3 id="anatopistic-sisu">Anatopistic Sisu</h3>

<p>The biggest culprit of language is Sisu. Sisu’s personality is just too modern Western (temporally and culturally) for a show set in the traditional East. She uses terms like “group projects”, “nightlights”, “Captain Pop-and-Lock”… especially for a creature of the culture, Sisu of all characters must be kept local.</p>

<p>But what about Mushu from Mulan, or the Genie from Aladdin? They’re also comedic relief characters whose premise are based on the culture, but their personality is way different.” Well, firstly, Mushu and Genie are HILARIOUS and charismatic. And I also think the writers were trying to replicate these iconic characters, but Sisu’s comedic dialogue choices just fall flat (“I’m not like… the bEsT dragon.”) and charisma is really important for holding suspension of disbelief.</p>

<p>It also does help that you had characters like the Matchmaker &amp; the Emperor, or the Sultan &amp; Jafar (basically the rest of the cast) who are VERY much stereotypical products of the culture, and they set the cultural norm/tone of the film’s setting, keeping the magical anachronistic characters as the one exception to the very consistently established rule. In Raya, no one’s characterization really screams “I’m a Southeast Asian!”.</p>

<p>It also helped that culture plays a pivotal role in the Aladdin and Mulan’s theme. The Matchmaker and Jafar, for example, are literal embodiments of the antagonistic forces that dictate the worth of people extrinsically, instead of who they really are intrinsically. And when characters like Mushu and Genie struggle with the exact same theme of extrinsic/intrinsic value, it makes them feel part of the same world. They could’ve leaned more on the idea of unity, a very SEA-centric value, in Sisu’s characterization.</p>

<p>And finally, in the same vein, Sisu carries her story’s worldbuilding much more than Mulan or Aladdin. The mystical elements in Mulan and Aladdin are quite simple and straightforward and already established since they don’t stray too far from the real world—especially when compared to the depth of world history and even sub-cultures found in Raya. This is compounded with the inconsistent <em>SEA-but-not-really</em> worldbuilding strategy. Dynasty-era China and psuedo-Agrabah are quite familiar settings. But in Raya, dragons are supposed to be the core of this new world, and Sisu is the only dragon we really see (and hear!) but we’re not quite sure whether the dragons are Southeast Asian, and by extension, whether the world is Southeast Asian.</p>

<p>From Aang (from <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>) alone, we understand so much of the pacifistic and virtuous values of the Air Nation as a whole, from this one person who is supposed to be the champion of its values. Imagine—Aang has an American personality like Sisu. We’d assume the entire Air Nation (and by extension, 1/4 of the Avatar world) is basic American. How much more so the dragons, which set the mood and tone all of Kumandra?</p>

<h3 id="sea-animals">SEA Animals</h3>

<p>Let’s talk about the creatures too. In real life, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/2059529/how-term-tuk-tuk-has-travelled-world" class="web-link">“Tuk-tuk” is a name for an auto rickshaw, popularized by Thailand and spread throughout the world!</a> True, Raya’s Tuk-Tuk does serve as her transport vehicle (a very cool design, no dispute) but Tuk-Tuk is a cross of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillidiidae" class="web-link">Armadillidiidae</a> (native to Europe) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillo" class="web-link">Armadillo - Wikipedia</a> (South America). Yes, they want to make Tuk-Tuk roll like a rickshaw’s wheel… but is it worth it?</p>

<p>Fang’s cat-tigers (which are named “Serlot”. Not very cultural) are based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracal" class="web-link">Caracals</a> (Central Asia at best) — at least let them have a Malayan Tiger’s stripes! Tail’s “Toot n’ Boom” beetle could be based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_marmorated_stink_bug#cite_note-2" class="web-link">Brown marmorated stink bug</a> (Northern Asia), and get this—they were <a href="https://collider.com/raya-and-the-last-dragon-farting-beetles-explained/" class="web-link">originally designed as farting gophers</a> (gophers are native to North America). And I quote, <em>“No one had one note and all of a sudden, here you have these characters whose main contribution to the movie is that they fart.</em>” KENAPE INI??</p>

<p>At least the “Ongi” monkeys (half-orangutan-half-<em>catfish</em>, apparently) from Talon are distinctly Southeast Asian. They achieved Talon’s entire culture quite authentically, and it does make a difference.</p>

<h3 id="misc-sea-things">Misc SEA things</h3>

<p>Even just funny Asian things like our easily swayed inclinations to “free gifts”, or certain characters having random silly superstitions about not eating certain types of meat or <em>X</em> catastrophe will happen. Even though it’s from China-Chinese, look at how The Wish Dragon handles weaving culture and story.</p>

<p>Early on, Young Raya talks about fighting with crossbows and flaming catapults. The former, perhaps, but I don’t think the latter was ever used in Southeast Asian warfare. That took me way out.</p>

<p>The voices could’ve had stronger accents too. This was another layer of dissonance for me, I couldn’t match the Southeast Asian I’m attuned to and am supposed to be hearing, versus the accents I was actually hearing. I am told that I myself don’t have a strong local accent, and that I speak Chinese/Malay with a noticeable degree of a [western] accent. I wouldn’t put myself forward to voice SEA-centric characters in a heavy SEA-inspired world. It’s like—it’s like getting these American accents to voice act in an animated Black Panther. It’s wrong to the Africans, it’s wrong to the SEA’ns.</p>

<p>Tiny details that should be too small to matter, like hairstyles to architecture… just doesn’t quite do it. It just feels too… <em>inconsistent</em>.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>And it feels intentionally globalized, when a story like this functions better if localized. Which is a shame, because other productions like [[Over The Moon – Film Review</td>
      <td>Over the Moon]] prove that it is possible to satisfyingly blend traditional cultures with otherworldly elements, even in an English language medium.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="sea-tribes">SEA Tribes</h3>

<p>So let’s get the subcultures down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Heart is <em>Indo-Malaysia</em> because “Raya”</li>
  <li>Fang is <em>Cambodia</em> because Angkor Wat</li>
  <li>(Talon’s perfect for what it is, nothing much to say here)</li>
  <li>and then <em>Viking/Japan</em> and <em>Africa</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And it’s no surprise that the two non-tropical tribes got the least screen time and least focus. They’re the weakest in terms of feeling distinctly SEA, to me. Because, imagine if we could allocate an entire 30-minute episode equally for each tribe/subculture.</p>

<p>I know Tail is supposed to represent the hotter regions/climates, but given 30 minutes, movie!Tail would end up as African to me. We don’t have sprawling sand deserts. We’re hot-and-humid, not hot-and-dry. I don’t think we’re huge on elaborate stronghold booby-traps either.</p>

<p>And in 30 minutes, Spine would remain Scandavanian-inspired from How to Train Your Dragon, if they had bamboo. The bamboo and the lack of a Scandavanian accent are the only distinction. Spine are characterized by being big in size (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_human_height_by_country" class="web-link">SEA people are genetically smaller on average</a>) and they have <em>snow</em>. We don’t have snow, so much so that literally every kid I know wish to travel to a country where they can experience snow.</p>

<h4 id="sea-authentic-tail">SEA-Authentic Tail</h4>

<pre><code class="language-screenplay">Zoom into the desert region of Kumandra and a TAIL MERCENARY sharpening a sharp blade…

YOUNG RAYA (V.O.)
First: Tail. A sweltering desert with sneaky mercenaries who fight dirty.
</code></pre>

<p>The closest thing that SEA has to a desert is <em><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bao-trang-the-white-sand-dunes" class="web-link">Bao Trang</a></em>, or the White Sand Dunes, in Vietnam. It has a huge lake. But this is the exception to the rule. Let’s not do sand deserts.</p>

<p>Instead, for inspiration for a Southeast-Asian Tail, Southeast Asia frequently goes through spells of drought. Tail could just have perpetual drought (perhaps because of <a href="#stealing-water" class="web-link">malicious crime</a>?), and could look like the pictures here: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/slideshow/worst-drought-decades-disrupts-life-southeast-asia-s-mekong-region-n562166" class="web-link">Worst Drought in Decades Disrupts Life in Southeast Asia’s Mekong Region</a>.</p>

<p>Now that’s a distinctly <em>Southeast Asian</em> wasteland. There may not be desert-sand, but the cracks in the ground shows parched forest-soil. The dead tree stumps. Even just the white sky feels more *right* than the saturated blue in the movie. Movie!Tail just looked too African to me.</p>

<p>And what if, Tail used to be a healthy mangrove swamp with flowing rivers — but then, because all the rivers dried up, it left behind the drought wasteland in the previous picture?</p>

<p>A large (ex-)mangrove swamp biome seems very in line with Tail in the final movie too, I can imagine a booby-trapped <em>swamp</em> stronghold, instead of a desert one!</p>

<h4 id="sea-authentic-spine">SEA-Authentic Spine</h4>

<pre><code class="language-screenplay">On the snow-covered mountains of Spine, we see an army of LARGE BARBARIANS.

YOUNG RAYA (V.O.)
Third: Spine. A frigid, bamboo forest guarded by exceedingly large warriors and their giant axes.
</code></pre>

<p>With the snow in Spine, I became 100% certain that the show wasn’t trying to be Southeast Asian. Like with their cast that have Northeast Asian heritage, the snowy bamboo forest was confused to be Southeast Asian when it’s really China/Korea/Japan. And they could’ve totally expanded the worldbuilding to encompass the whole of East Asia — but no, the Spine tribespeople have dark skin. In a cold, dark, snowy climate, where they should be lighter-skinned.</p>

<p>Even the Water Tribe in Avatar: The Last Airbender needed to move away from its East Asian cultures of the other three tribes to use Inuit/Native American cultures, because East Asia simply does not have that kind specific kind of biome to realistically tie in Asian culture with freezing climates, especially since the Water Tribes are literally the North and South Pole, the coldest you can go. You can’t make a culture that wants the hot and dry African/Middle-Eastern culture, clothing and lifestyle, with an Antarctica climate and environment. It’s just not realistic.</p>

<p>To stick with SEA, you could change Spine to look more like Shang-Chi’s bamboo forest, but with a cooler bluish tint:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Let them be lighter-skinned. There could still be patches of snow, but not everywhere.</p>

<p>Bamboo biomes are generally quite flat and not mountainous. We could just call it as a bamboo forest on a plain on a mountain. I won’t comment too much on the mountain aspect, because Spine</p>

<p>And it would add depth to have people from Spine say, “We used to have chili from Tail to make Kumandra Stew, we miss the spiciness that helped to warm us in the cold. Not anymore since the Druun.” There’s so much to build on!</p>

<p>We also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_pencak_silat" class="web-link">don’t really use giant axes</a>. And Google has just informed me that nobody uses giant axes to cut bamboo (they use saws/shears, because it’s <em>that</em> sturdy) so it doesn’t make too much sense for Spine to main axes. Heavy swings get stuck on bamboo. Spine’s choice of weaponry should be natural product of its environment… literally? What about bamboo spears?</p>

<h2 id="rain-and-floods">Rain and Floods</h2>

<h3 id="kumandras-lack-of-rain">Kumandra’s Lack of Rain</h3>

<p>So here in Malaysia, the bright/hot/draught season just gave way to gloomy/windy/wet rainy season. Roads/rivers flooding and soft-earth landslides and just being soaked in weighty downpour. Heavy tropical showers are just as distinctly Southeast Asian as the Hot-Humid climate.</p>

<p>And it just hit me: Raya never shows this side of the tropical climate, in any of the Tribes at any part of the story. Though, then again, it doesn’t truly explore the hot-but-humid-not-dry plains, going through the dense rainforests—by virtue of clothing, flora/fauna, or the practices.</p>

<p>This is consciously chalked down to the dragons disappearing and that meant that the rains/rivers would be held back, and with the lack of water, the Druun could wreck havoc. So if the Druun are to have their reign, we can’t have our rain.</p>

<p>But… Fang had a whole waterfall. It dried up when Sisu is killed by the arrow, but it presumably was flowing even before Sisu was brought back. Now you could argue that Sisu had disappeared but not yet <em>died</em>, but <strong>if we can have waterfalls, why not have tropical rains?</strong> Perhaps global rain would make the Druun so much less of a threat, since we established water to be such a powerful Kryptonite. But we can lean into this and twist a story out of it!</p>

<p>So it’s established that that the Druun are weak to water. And that since the dragons disappeared and the Dragon Gem got shattered, the rivers started drying up. But Fang’s rivers are flowing as strongly as ever, if not stronger than before. So, <strong>what if the rivers didn’t dry up because of magic, but literally because of human distrust and discord? What if… Fang redirected the waters from the other tribes to its own land?</strong> OH HO HO that’s such a good plot element. Ugh.</p>

<h3 id="stealing-water">Stealing Water</h3>

<p>Let’s tweak the story:</p>

<ul>
  <li>After the Gem gets divided, it doesn’t really matter if the story needs the waters to start to dry up or it’s already been drying. The point is, everyone already knows that water wards off the Druun.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Fang immediately starts diverting rivers and constructing channels/pumps.</strong> Lol what if we had magic seeds that grows into plants that somehow causes the air around it to whatever, and attracts clouds (cloud seeding LOL).</li>
  <li>Fang becomes really immune to the Druun. Their climate turns into one that rains so often and so heavy, and the water cycle is just trapped in their region.</li>
  <li>Clashing between tribes gets bad to the point that they’re just cutting off water supply to other tribes—even when it doesn’t benefit them! Poisoning water sources. Spilling water into contaminated land. And only pure water (fit for drinking and sustaining life) can ward off the Druun. Thirst and sickness weakens and kills whoever isn’t petrified by the Druun, especially in Heart and Tail.</li>
  <li>The other Tribes don’t have a clue what’s going on, but they note that over the years, the water levels are going down, and the Druun are getting more powerful in their land. Just as Fang’s water levels go up.</li>
  <li>This also plays into Raya: she starts the story by visiting hundreds of rivers across all the land, to find the one river that would summon Sisu. We could explain the countless failed attempts by having the prophecy/instruction manual state that Sisu can only be summoned at a river of pure water. Everyone’s water is at least slightly contaminated. Even Fang’s waters, their contamination of other waters had led back into their own. That’s why it took her so long to track down the one last pure river in uninhabited Tail.</li>
  <li>However, too much water is also a real problem in Southeast Asia. Fang starts overloading with water: the crops fail because the farmland floods; landslides cause property damage; commerce is disrupted when it there’s <em>hujan lebat</em>. Some children have literally never seen the sun, ‘cause it’s all dark rainclouds. Fang, though safe from the Druun, are royally suffering. These problems slowly reveal throughout the story, from the perspectives of different Fang citizens.</li>
</ul>

<p>In light of all the Fang water-stealing conspiracy, a 6-year timespan is too short for a such a drastic change in the world. We can chalk it up to the shattered Dragon Gem that literally amplifies the effects of a divided world. But such global and slow-burn sequence of events need time to spiral out of control and to form a new era of deep culture and beliefs.</p>

<p>Avatar: The Last Airbender had 100-years for the Fire Nation to methodically stamp their mark on the world, and to fully develop the consequences of Aang’s flaw of running away when the world needed him the most. People could have lived a full life without an Avatar in the picture. And that is what precisely sets the stage for Aang: these peoples’ kids, whose parents had hoped for the Avatar’s return, and never got it. You get powers that really go unchecked (the Fire Nation, Dai Li) and such interesting characters like people taking justice into their own vigilante hands (Jet, Hama). Ugh ATLA.</p>

<p>But Raya and Naamari were the cause of the Gem breaking. Without a cryo-chamber moment, even as prodigies they’d have to be at least 12 to be somewhat competent enough in combat for Raya to best her Father, right before the shattered Gem betrayal. And then they can’t be older than 30 in the present-day adventure, because they’d be rather old. Either ways, I think at least 15-20 years’ space between the shattered Gem betrayal and the audience’s present-day story adventure, would strike a balance. Though it’s still not enough breathing space for a water conspiracy to mar Kumandra.</p>

<p>We could say that Fang had been stealing water for centuries past (but the Druun were banished when the dragons disappeared? Maybe they did this in preemptively/in precaution if they came back), and the other nations already started feeling the ill effects, which played into the tensions during Chief Benja’s time. But originally, early on Chief Benja says that the other tribes think that Heart prospered much more than the others because they held the Gem, if not, the other tribes would be bothering Fang instead.</p>

<h3 id="wicked-heart">Wicked Heart</h3>

<p>Which leads to another tweak. <strong>What if. Instead of the stereotypical ruthless Fang… it’s actually Heart that has been doing the water diverting and poisoning and prospering off it?</strong> This is a Dai Li moment. After all, all have fallen short and the heart is deceitful above all else. Yes, this means Chief Benja, Raya’s father, is just another player in this game of life. Fang is ruthless, yes, but Heart is insatiably wicked.</p>

<p>So, new rewrite:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For centuries since the dragons disappeared, Heart had been diverting waters from the different lands into its own. That’s why it’s been such a protected and healthy rainforest.
    <ul>
      <li>Maybe they had been diverting waters for centuries before that. But they continued the practice even after the Druun were banished, maybe because
        <ol>
          <li>There were still some Druun left, it could’ve petrified the Heart chief’s family or something</li>
          <li>The Druun are gone, but as a precaution if they came back</li>
          <li>Regardless of the Druun, the waters brought life and prosperity to Heart.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Furthermore, Heart keeping the Gem helped to cover up their prosperity as a result of the tribe possessing the Gem, and not because of their nefarious water-stealing practices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Chief Benja was just another chief-in-line to continue the practice. We keep the painting of Heart to be so noble and pacifist and championing unity of one-Kumandra—especially in contrast with the evil, untrustworthy, openly-treasonous Fang.</li>
  <li>In Episode 1, Chief Benja calls all the Tribes together for a meal. They accuse Heart of hogging the Gem, but also a one-off statement is made about the drying rivers. We the audience don’t feel any weight to any of these accusations, as they’re just jealous.</li>
  <li>The story goes on as usual. Along with the audience, Raya still believes that Fang is 100% in the wrong for the world falling apart. She feels 100% justified in stealing the gem pieces to save her father and the world.</li>
  <li>As they’re leaving Talon with all the pieces save for Fang’s, Raya states that Fang’s gem piece is impossible to obtain, as their military and security is just too tight.</li>
  <li>In a shocking moment: Raya takes the four gem pieces for herself and slips away from the gang in the night as they’re traveling by Heart. All five gem pieces are required to restore all Kumandra, but using up four gem pieces is just enough to revitalize Heart, the poor victim. Going to Fang is a doomed suicide mission anyways, and Raya really doesn’t care about the other tribes. She can argue with her animal friend Tuk-Tuk to externalize her beliefs to the audience.
    <ul>
      <li>The gang realizes what she’s going to do, and are indignant. They sail down to Heart.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Raya excitedly first revives her father so he can witness the restoration of the entire tribe. Chief Benja comes back to life. They reunite, happy happy, but Benja notes that Raya only has four pieces and realizes Raya’s plan.</li>
  <li>Benja confesses <del>his war crimes</del> and reveals Heart’s dark history of water stealing. Raya is disgusted, and feels personally betrayed by her father after victimizing Heart before the other tribes. But it’s noted that Raya is guilty of the sin that runs in the family: she, too, had betrayed her gang by taking the gem pieces for her own tribe.</li>
  <li>Benja regrets and wants to set things right by treatying with Fang as the original chief of Heart, while Raya is sunk too deep into cynicism. She scoffs, “Ha! Dad, if you can get a Fang to unite together with the other tribes, then we talk. But if my own tribe, my own father, has always been this deceptive and selfish, then the world might as well be—I might as well be. At least I’ll save my tribe in the process.”</li>
  <li>So they fight it out on the bridge. It’s a callback, the gem (pieces) in the center, and Benja preventing Raya from passing him to get it. Benja notes that in his time as chief, Raya was the only one he had to fight in protecting the Gem. It’s a tragic fight.</li>
  <li>The gang arrives (without Sisu, we’ll get to that later, but she’s too powerful to be here now). They notes Benja is alive, and Benja recognizes Tong as Spine’s chief. The gang knows what Raya is trying to do, and it becomes a everyone-for-themselves swordfight.
    <ul>
      <li>All of them are expert combatants, except for Little Noi (and the monkeys), who sneakily steals a gem piece, only for someone else to snatch it back and forth. Benja definitely dominates here in a group setting, and is more careful. And of course, Boun doesn’t fight, so maybe Tail’s gem piece is mainly being kept by Benja.</li>
      <li>But the point is: after all the bonding so far, the gang had all devolved back to the first time every tribe was snatching up the gem pieces when it was first broken.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Raya knows she can’t fight them all, so she takes Heart’s gem piece and dives off the bridge. Benja looks on, like he did when he sacrificed himself for her.</li>
  <li>The gang to go on their way with their own gem piece… but Boun and Little Noi have no one to go back to. Benja and Tong’s heartstrings get tugged. Benja rallies the gang to go to Fang. Like Raya scoffed, if they can somehow get Fang’s cooperation (through Benja’s revival), then Raya has no reason not to restore all Kumandra.</li>
</ul>

<p>So in this rewrite, Raya goes rogue, not Naamari. Benja organizes a three-way meeting between the gang, Naamari, and Raya. Raya, fully leaning into the willingness to betray, is instead the one who springs up the surprise crossbow. Naamari intervenes out of distrust, and this gets Sisu killed.</p>

<p>Waters fail, the Druun rise. Benja gets petrified again but this time from saving Naamari. Raya causes Virana to get petrified while she scrambles for the gem pieces to revive Benja. She gets the four gem pieces as she did before, but the gem doesn’t work because Sisu is dead. This petrification is permanent. Their parents are gone. So, they fight it out like they did in the original.</p>

<p>UGH I love rewriting</p>

<h2 id="cooler-gem-weapons">Cooler Gem Weapons</h2>

<p>When one of the main gang simply holds out a gem piece to ward off a Druun: it’s kind of a lame action. It’s not very visual, nor shows off fantastical physical feats, or at least <em>some</em> effort on the character’s part to effectively wield the gem stones.</p>

<p>It would be WAY cooler if every tribe’s gem piece should be incorporated uniquely into tribe-centric artifacts. Think of it exactly like the containers for <em>Marvel</em>’s <em>Avenger</em>’s Infinity Stones (the <em>Tesserect</em> for the Space Stone, the <em>Aether</em> for the Reality Stone, etc.), or like <em>Pirate of the Caribbean</em>’s <em>At World’s End</em>’s “Pieces of Eight” ( #TODO )! The gem piece would enchant the weapon (with a shimmer animation when it’s attached) and make it super effective against the Druun. Plus, it’s extra opportunity to showcase SEA culture.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chief Benja’s gem-embedded chain-whip-sword <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris" class="web-link">kris/keris</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalis" class="web-link">kalis</a> for Heart</li>
  <li>Naamari’s dragon pendant for Fang, embedded on top of Virana’s (Naamari’s mom) scepter (perhaps like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trishula" class="web-link">trishula</a>?) Whose tip can be unattached and become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekpi" class="web-link">tekpi/chabang</a>?</li>
  <li>I was today years old when I learnt the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karambit" class="web-link">karambit</a> is a SEA thing. It’s literally a Talon. Perfect for close-quarters swindling thieves.</li>
  <li>A gem-tipped bamboo spear for Spine, magically unbreakable—bamboo is literally used in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVDpbVJ8rBU" class="web-link">tongkat/toya/lembing silat</a>
</li>
  <li>Tail’s the most underdeveloped story-wise, so they could have anything, really. But look at this beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kujang_(weapon)" class="web-link">kujang</a>. Though if Tail’s main industry were to be agriculture, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celurit" class="web-link">celurit/sabit</a> is another culturally-beautiful weapon/tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, as each member of the gang use a Gem Piece to fight off the Druun, they can actually incorporate expert combat skills and unique fighting styles.</p>

<p>I had a really fun time reading through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_pencak_silat" class="web-link">Weapons of pencak silat - Wikipedia</a>. My culture is so colorful.</p>

<h2 id="conclusive-thoughts">Conclusive thoughts</h2>

<p>Cultural authenticity is clearly not a core value enforced during the production. I say this not as a complaint, as otherworldy stories are supposed to be unfamiliar and curious—but as an observation that story production heads consciously decided to dip their toes in both sides of the fence and never commit to one.</p>

<p>I don’t attribute all this to COVID lockdown preventing larger theatre profit-per-viewer rates because it was set to release in 2020 and it’s clear production was following this direction from the very start, which could be from years back. My gander is that this is the product of two factors:</p>

<p>One: (executives may think) international audiences have no interest to care for a Southeast Asian story (SEA is such a small market for an international <em>Disney</em> movie); let alone Disney+ was ironically not yet available/accessible in many countries in Southeast Asia at the time. So to <em>attract</em> more viewership, they mold it to be more <em>relatable</em> (“Westerners won’t know what <em>laksa</em> is, just call it stew!”), which means to expand the cultural umbrella (globalization and generalization).</p>

<p>And the second, more egregious, but less conniving reason could be that everyone in production just comes from a Western context. Look at <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5109280/fullcredits" class="web-link">Raya and the Last Dragon (2021) - Full Cast &amp; Crew - IMDb</a>. The directors, writers, cast. Most of them don’t have a Southeast Asian heritage. The few who do, have basically lived in white America all their lives, and are more American than Southeast Asian. Actually, practically all these people would say that their primary identity is American. And I would wager that for the overwhelming majority of the production team.</p>

<p>Nobody from production really lived in Southeast Asia. These people’s culture isn’t shaped by 2-hour flooded traffic jams or surveying fabrics and unhealthy snacks in crowded night street markets.</p>

<p>It’s just that they marketed and branded this movie’s identity, even in-universe, as Southeast Asian. <strong>But then they show things that are not characteristically Southeast Asian, and then label it as Southeast Asian to the world.</strong></p>

<p>I get why cultural authenticity is so important now. ‘Cause it’s <em>almost</em> as if they’re saying (even if not on purpose), “Hey, <em>this</em> is what your culture looks like to us, this is how the rest of world will perceive it. If your life doesn’t look like this, maybe you’re not doing it right. Maybe you’re invalid to associate with the Southeast Asian identity.”</p>

<p>I’ve never paid a second thought to cultural considerations in story. They were always a means to an end, malleable to whatever the story needs it to be. But now I understand that story breathes through culture. And that nailing the culture aspect can beautifully define the physical shape of story.</p>

<p>It’s just like caring enough to learn how to speak someone’s native language fluently, and instead of talking into their ears, you get to speak directly with their heart.</p>

<p>Strike one, a weird sequence of events: when Mal returns to the Island for the first time, she goes straight to her house.

<p>Strike two: Chad kept letting loose about usurping Ben for the King to impress Audrey. He even catches on that Ben was kidnapped and was told not to tell anyone, but that setup never got resolved. And then he was never to be seen again. Wikipedia says that Audrey’s actress was not involved in this movie, but the script awkwardly left traces of her character.</p>

<p>Strike three: as Mal was packing to run away, she takes back her mother, lizard!Maleficent, in a box with holes. But that’s never revisited again. What happens?!?! Apparently a spin-off book explains strikes two and three, but the in-story movie itself feels weird, and Chekov’s gun, y’know.</p>

<h2 id="things-id-tweak-">Things I’d Tweak 🔧</h2>

<h3 id="1-pacing-and-songs">1. Pacing and songs</h3>

<p>Foremostly, the <strong>movie’s pacing is a mess</strong>. The four Acts were so unevenly split: 35-10-35-20 when it should be closely split 25-25-25-25 over about a 100 minutes’ runtime. A whole lot of the First Act was a mess. Many songs don’t develop the story.</p>

<h4 id="1a-ways-to-be-wicked">1a. Ways to be Wicked</h4>

<p><strong><em>Ways to be Wicked</em></strong> is literally an outtake song from the first movie that lost to <em>Rotten to the Core</em>: you can tell, the bridge goes “Mother always knows best (also, that Tangled reference)” and “Hear her voice in my head”, which I liked, though “rotten to the core” is a more fitting theme overall. But it’s such a weird choice as an opening song for the second movie, because the first 5 minutes does nothing for the story when it’s revealed: it was all a dream. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Instead, start in the real world, with one of those ensemble songs to introduce everyone’s plot goals, centred around preparing for the Catalion.</code></p>

<h4 id="1b-the-space-between">1b. The Space Between</h4>

<p><strong><em>The Space Between</em></strong> was kind of a directionless song, and seems like an imitation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8YMfgu92hQ" class="web-link">For Good (From “Wicked” Original Broadway Cast Recording/2003) - YouTube</a>. ‘Cause, while it was somewhat appropriate to their character arcs so far: absolutely nothing <em>changes</em> about the story through and after the song. And that’s because by being so cordial, the song effectively <em>sidesteps conflict</em> instead of <em>tackling conflict</em> — conflict is the engine of a story.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Let’s flip the song on its head, calling it:</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">No Space Between</code></em>. As per the original plot, Evie wants to convince Mal to stay with her in Auradon, but instead it turns out: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mal also wants Evie to stay with her on the Isle. They both realise how unlimited they can be together, which makes it even more tragic when they sing and realise that there’s “no space between” the Isle and Auradon: it’s one or the other. That’s the theme of the story. They start to argue, escalating dramatically until Mal steps too far and magicks Evie. The song ends the same with the two disagreeing, but now it’s more tragic. They don’t even need to reunite right away upon learning Ben was kidnapped. Draw it out long.</code></p>

<p>I discuss <em>What’s My Name?</em> later.</p>

<h3 id="2-jay--carlos">2. Jay &amp; Carlos</h3>

<p>I feel like <strong>they didn’t know what to do with Jay and Carlos</strong>. Jay’s arc would’ve made sense with my Descendants 1 rewrite where Jay was more like Jafar, hating to be number two—giving up captainship to someone else means a lot more, showing he’s really not the person he used to be. Carlos (and Jane) was sidelined to a lame asking-a-girl-out subplot.</p>

<p>Credit due, Carlos proved to be the heart of the group as they said he was, getting everyone into that heart-to-heart. Then Jay offered to drive Mal back. Nice, but <strong>we need more plot threads as to why Jay and Carlos HAD to be on the mission in the first place</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perhaps only Jay knew how to drive a car, plus he was good muscle.</code></p>

<h3 id="3-remembering-janes-arc">3. Remembering Jane’s arc</h3>

<p>Welp, we spent the last movie exploring Jane, how she wanted a cooler hairstyle to become popular and accepted, and how <strong>Jane’s thinking was superficial and skin deep</strong>. But in this movie, without explanation, she has stylish hair now, plus she’s suddenly more confident and Carlos suddenly digs her. Is it because of who she’s become on the inside? Or is it because of how she <em>looks</em> on the outside? It’s never explored, and this does a 180º on a really good message from the first movie. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">So yes. Either keep Jane’s old hair, or maybe have some plot event temporarily ruins her hair, but show Carlos and Jane not caring.</code></p>

<h3 id="4-bringing-back-the-parents">4. Bringing back the parents</h3>

<p>So the gang made an off-remark about returning to the Island: “Stay low, I hope we don’t bump into our parents!” which is a shame because if not for Kristen Chennowyth’s casting expenses, <strong>the parents’ appearances would be a great <a href="https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/improve-your-character-instantly-just/" class="web-link">Ghost</a></strong> to haunt the kids.</p>

<p><strong>What if</strong> when Ben gets captured, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">they are forced to meet their parents to get some resources from them to get Ben back—perhaps components for a 3D printer so that they don’t have to awkwardly travel back to Auradon, and back again. Even if not the parents, they could bump into their lackeys, extensions of their antagonism. They would marvel at how much their children individually changed and how much they’re not “of the Island” anymore, further proving their growth.</code></p>

<h3 id="5-ben-gets-himself-kidnapped">5. Ben gets himself kidnapped</h3>

<p>So <strong>Ben just wanders off and gets kidnapped</strong> somehow while Evie speaks to Mal, and none of the guys took notice. Wat. Coincidences makes not a good story. <a href="https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/secret-writing-dynamic-characters-always-fault/" class="web-link">Always blame your characters.</a> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What if the pirate gang ambushes our gang, turning into a street chase where they have to split up? Our gang are hesitant to knock over stalls to get ahead because they’re good now (in blinding contrast to their intro song, Rotten to the Core), but because the pirates don’t care, they catch up to them. At one point, Ben chooses to save a kid in danger, and this gets him caught.</code></p>

<h3 id="6-the-perfect-auradon-girl">6. The perfect Auradon girl</h3>

<p>At the start, Mal always says “I’m not an Auradon girl,” but wouldn’t it be great if perhaps <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">in an interview, Mal messes up and Audrey steps in to save the day, and the interviewers swarm Audrey instead and she handles the limelight well. Even unintentionally,</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Audrey is the paragon of a “perfect Auradon girl”.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">During the picnic argument, Mal brings this up to Ben and he replies, “I’m not looking for a perfect Auradon girl. I’m looking for you.”</code></p>

<p>I call it The Audrey Rewrite. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mal would frequently mention or imply Audrey when asserting that she’s not *good*. Even as a passive background character,</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Audrey’s existence actively reminds Mal of who she can never be, leading Mal to realise who she already is, who always has been and always will be.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">It would also be interesting in the climax to see Audrey quickly realising what’s happening when Ben gets bewitched by Uma, because that’s what Mal did in the first movie. And then her weird mixed feelings towards Mal: some sympathy, some unearthed hurt from the past.</code></p>

<h3 id="7-arm-wrestling-with-stakes">7. Arm wrestling with stakes</h3>

<p><strong>The arm wrestling scene</strong> didn’t really do much as the Midpoint. We see their rivalry, some banter, but nothing more. Consider this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mal walks in. They squabble because their mothers were rival leaders of territories, too.</code> Granted, it was a nice detail that Uma makes a deal, like Ursula did/does. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">But she could make a more interesting deal: If Uma wins, she gets the Wand. If Mal wins, she also gets Ursula’s magic seashell, making Mal effectively the most powerful person on the Isle, winning Ursula’s half of the Isle for her mother, besides cementing Mal’s decision to stay on the Isle.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">They arm wrestle to the death, and where Mal’s eyes glow green, Uma’s seashell glows teal. Starting to lose, Uma taunts Mal that she knows that Mal used a love potion on Ben, how Mal is ruthless and evil and really belongs to the island as much as Uma doesn’t want her to stay. As much as Uma, Mal, Ben, anyone denies it: Mal was an Island girl through and through. Mal slowly breaks and suddenly spurts out that she loves them both equally—a catharsis that makes her lose focus and the arm wrestle. Mal loses the fight; but she realises the Midpoint truth: she is both Island and Auradon.</code></p>

<h2 id="things-i-liked-️">Things I Liked ❤️</h2>

<h3 id="1-complex-evie">1. Complex Evie</h3>

<p>Again, <strong>Evie is my favourite character</strong>. She gets a great parallel arc with Mal. She has really great chemistry with Ben and Dizzy. I liked the part where she catches the kids stealing her wallet—but then decides to let them keep it, compassionate heartbreak across her face. It’s complex: on one hand, she’s kind-hearted now—an Island-girl-no-more; but, she’s also got a large place in her heart for the people of her Island. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">But let’s up the ante.</code> <em>Chilling Like a Villain</em> doesn’t do anything story-wise, because Ben never got a chance to feign his true self as Evie had warned him to—and Gil coincidentally bumps into them.</p>

<p>What if we rearrange the events so that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the stealing kids come right after Carlos and Jay hush them because a curious crowd is forming as kindness isn’t local behaviour. As the crowd starts to recognise the daughter of the Evil Queen, Evie chooses to let the kids go, furthermore letting them keep the money, and consequently exposes the gang: ironically, Ben wouldn’t be the one to crack, but Evie would. This would be Evie’s characteristic catharsis. Gil is part of the crowd that forms, exposing the gang to Uma, giving plot consequences to Evi'e characteristic moment. Beautiful.</code> I also think that there’s potential contrast between small, nerdy Doug v.s. big, jockish Gil. Especially when Evie’s mom was all about the “fairest of them all” while Gaston was “a perfect, a pure paragon”!</p>

<h3 id="2-ben-the-paragon">2. Ben, the Paragon</h3>

<p>They also did <strong>Ben good as the paragon</strong> of all things sunshine. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Might’ve used a little more setup for him losing his temper at the picnic.</code> But he had good reason to. It was good to put Mr. Perfect in unfamiliar shoes: blending in with the Island; in the climax, bewitching him to creepily ignore Mal. This works well because it is in such contrast with moments where he basically was ready to die for the good he believed in. He has the same climax as the first movie of bargaining with a conflicted kid from the Isle from going too far—but that’s what he’s all about, and it works.</p>

<h3 id="3-uma-eventually">3. Uma, eventually</h3>

<h4 id="umas-chemistry-with-ben">Uma’s chemistry with Ben</h4>

<p>Uma started off boring. The first scene and introduction song <em>What’s My Name?</em> was out of place — she expresses her character wants but has no plot goals yet. She doesn’t need to appear in the story yet.</p>

<p>But in the end I liked <strong>Uma’s chemistry with Ben</strong> on the ship, showing just a glimmer of her tragic innocence, and how she’s somewhat redeemable: this makes her sudden appearance in the Final Act not be completely out of the left field. It’s also really apt how she, like Ursula, used magic to make the guy fall in love with her.</p>

<h4 id="whats-my-name">What’s My Name?</h4>

<p>What if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">we cut that introductory scene in the First Act completely.</code> Fast forward to the Second Act, a kidnapped Ben is brought to her and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meets her for the first time along with the audience. Ben would legitimately ask who she is.</code> Then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">only now does</code> Uma sing <em>What’s My Name?</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">to introduce herself to Ben (and the audience).</code> This is great, especially since even in the original story, Uma complained how she was forgotten by the King of Auradon. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">This relocated scene should not take place in the bar/den or on the ship, since there are already other important set pieces in those locations already (the arm-wrestling scene and the swordfight scene), besides also being chronologically closeby.</code> The scene can just end with Uma’s original dialogue with Ben.</p>

<h3 id="4-harry-hooks-actor">4. Harry Hook’s actor</h3>

<p><strong>Harry Hook</strong> is played so wildly and eccentrically. He perfectly fills the role of the kid who was born on the Island and made the choice to be evil—contrasted with Uma at the pirate ship as she scolds him for pushing Ben nearer off the plank. While both have made bad choices, there’s an important distinction between Uma and Harry. Straightforward, fun and resonant—it works. He doesn’t need redemption, he’s just evil through and through. I’m mad he doesn’t have a bigger role in the story nor the finale.</p>

<p>What if, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">after Uma’s deception is revealed in the finale, Harry and Gil appear with a pirate ship as violent plan B—they too had escaped the dome with Uma. A whole CGI battle ensues where Evie, Carlos and Jay get to fight a bit… Then in the climax, Ben convinces Uma to surrender and she retreats, dragging the pirate ship back with her. More action.</code>Also, how’s she supposed to go back into the dome now that it’s closed again? It’s explained in the sequel movie but even so, uhhh?? <em>So I’ve been informed that this was addressed in the third instalment. Cool.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Just submitted my interim report for my final year dissertation. I got to learn LaTeX, and got this Latex Workshop extension for VS Code. Recommend, I can’t imagine doing LaTeX on anything other than VS Code.</p>

<p>I feel like this year is going to be a repeat of last year around this time, just busy busy busy with academics and barely getting any writing output over this semester. I’m so behind with work for next semester, too.</p>

<p>But we (with my flatmates) (impulse) bought a MIDI keyboard! I’m on day 3 of at least 30 minutes of practice a day. Hopefully this improves my writing, from a musical perspective!</p>

<p>Anyways. Merry Christmas!</p>

  <li>The Emperor explains the quest:
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Last of the Huns are one big nomadic group, raiding our cities</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Taking advantage of Shan Yu’s mostly successful military campaign from the previous movie</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The number of fit males-of-age are too depleted.</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">In Mulan I, they relaxed the conscription conditions, so desperation is why they extended the conscripted Mulan’s old father, along with Shang’s troop made up of previously “unfit for war” males like the Gang of Three</code></li>
      <li>Instead: we will send princesses to make an alliance with a neighbouring kingdom.</li>

  <li>Mulan <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doesn’t</code>react about arranged marriages, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">but does voice her concern for the princesses:</code> the Emperor replies that they understand their duty and accept the honour.</li>

  <li>Yao expresses his infatuation to the Gang of Three, but the other two remind him that these princesses are engaged,<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and that to be entrusted as a royal escort was the highest honour for a soldier. Who could ever ask for more? Yao huffs.</code>

<pre><code class="language-screenplay-edited">Mushu blows a flame onto one of the bombs, and it goes off with a BANG!

SHANG
An ambush!

MULAN
I think one of the bombs just exploded by itself.

They run over to their supplies pile. Scorch marks stain and ruin various items.

SHANG
Our supplies are ruined! Mulan, you were supposed to watch the bombs!

MULAN
No, it becomes your duty after sunset!

They clean up the mess. Mushu and Cri-Kee watch them closely, hidden in a tree.

MUSHU
It's working!

SHANG
The runaway carriage was not my fault, and I'm sure it wasn't an accident. I'm an elite soldier — nothing gets past me.

Without warning, Mulan crashes a bo staff down onto Shang from behind.

Shang rolls out of the way, aghast.

MULAN
(smirking)
I got past you, didn't I?

Mulan continues attacking, so Shang ditches the supplies and picks a bo staff of his own to spar.

SHANG
Are you taking the mission seriously?

MULAN
Tonight would’ve been our honeymoon night, so, no, I’m not! Are YOU taking our MARRIAGE seriously?

Mulan's attack causes Shang to step back, and pause.

SHANG
(solemn)
Listen, Mulan. If somehow, during the mission... I somehow... die... will you complete the mission?

MULAN
(appalled)
If you DIED?! Why would you DIE?!

They continue, but Mulan starts throwing fatal blows.

SHANG
Because of the mission! I just said so! It’s a simple question — why’s it so hard to give me a simple answer?

MULAN
(talking over each other)
You can’t die! We were supposed to be married! What kind of question is that?!

Mulan sends Shang's staff flying, jabbing her own staff at Shang’s neck in victory.

MULAN
I told you we SHOULDN'T have come on this mission.

Shang wrestles the staff out of Mulan’s hands, reversing their position.

SHANG
No – I need to do this mission.

MULAN
(softens)
Shang – tell me what’s on your heart.

SHANG
(waves it off)
Nothing. I’m going to rest before tomorrow’s journey. Good night.

Shang tosses away his staff and heads into his tent. Mulan takes over the night watch with Mushu.

</li>
  <li>But Shang <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">harshly shushes her,</code> puts his foot down and forbids the pairs to talk.</li>
  <li>Now alone, Shang blames Mulan for filling their minds with heart over duty.

  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shang huffs, “Men, all across the nation, way too young and far too old — they CHOSE to honour some parchment bearing their family name.

</li>
  <li>Mulan and Shang fall into the river. Mulan grabs a rope hanging by its thread. Shang holds onto and weighs on her, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">being pulled by the current.</code>

<h2 id="five-things-id-tweak-">Five Things I’d Tweak 🔧</h2>

<h3 id="1-inappropriate-climactic-music">1. Inappropriate climactic music</h3>

<p>Only had one real problem with the show: the playful, <strong>comedic background music in the serious climax</strong> after Maleficent freezes everyone. It’s the final showdown between protagonist and antagonist, but it really kills the mood and makes the stakes feel trivial. It’s not a scriptwriting problem: the dialogue was true, but wow was the music jarring. Which is weird, because musical themes in background music everywhere else were on point.</p>

<h3 id="2-mals-other-sketches">2. Mal’s other sketches</h3>

<p>Mal is an artist. We see her spray paint everything and compulsively draw sketches of the Magic Wand in her sketchbook. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What if, after her date with Ben, she flips her sketchbook and</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">starts drawing sketches of Ben instead</code></strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">literally turning over a new page. And then later after the Family Day feud disaster, she can rip off and crumple her sketch of Ben, returning to the Magic Wand sketch and her old self. And then before the climax as she makes the Anti-Love potion, she can uncrumple the sketches of Ben beside her, illustrating to the audience of her inner conflict and his impact on her.</code></p>

<h3 id="3-jays-character-arc">3. Jay’s character arc</h3>

<p>“And he likes to hurt people!” was Chad’s accusation of Jay, but no one got seriously hurt. Chad once mentioned off-handedly that his phone was stolen, but I don’t think stealing was really Jafar’s thing either, <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I think Jay’s most resonant arc would’ve been pride in self vs. humility in teamwork</code>.</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jafar himself couldn’t accept being number two. Jay would start off muscle-ing the rest of the gang: if he could get the Wand before Mal, his father could one-up Maleficent. This is why he hastily trips the alarm in the museum. At his first time on the tourney field, Coach tells him that he would’ve scored without fouls if only he had passed the ball. At the 50% mark in the big match against the rivals, in the last seconds, Chad is in the clear, but Jay selfishly hesitates, but then Chad gets marked, so Jay passes to Ben to make the winning shot. Chad was so close at being the winning scorer, and later this is what Chad accuses him of on Family Day: “Jay is after Ben’s role as team captain! What next, Auradon?!”</code></p>

<h3 id="4-closer-character-climaxes">4. Closer character climaxes</h3>

<p>In the climax, the gang put their fists-in-a-ring thing, and choose good, resolving their internal arcs there. Then later, Maleficent comes, we have the back and forth, then final battle, resolving their external arcs there much later. <strong>Resonance is amplified when as many arcs climax as close to each other as possible</strong>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">like constructive interference. After Mal chooses to be good because of Ben, she can still make her speech, but the gang don’t look fully convinced. Then her mother crashes in, but the gang doesn’t back Mal from the beginning.</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Only when the battle starts, then the gang step into action one-by-one,</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">so the audience, together with Mal, get this climax at the most important last moment possible.</code></p>

<h3 id="5-audreys-character-arc">5. Audrey’s character arc</h3>

<p>Not sure what to think of <strong>Audrey’s arc</strong>. Chad’s right: Mal stole Audrey’s boyfriend, who she seems to be happy with. Furthermore, her grandma would know that Mal ruined Audrey’s relationship with the heir to the throne. And in the Resolution, Mal steals Audrey’s place for the throne, and Audrey just curtsies away? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">But: what if Audrey and Ben were in an incompatible relationship? And when Ben reveals his facade to Mal at the coronation, he also says that after the love potion wore off on their first date, he immediately formally broke up with Audrey (so he never did Audrey any wrong). He’s still the only one who knows of the love potion: Ben acknowledges that Mal was still 100% in the wrong for it—but he plays along, because he believed in Mal, that she would do the right thing somehow, and she does. In the Resolution, Mal should apologise to Audrey, and Audrey can also sympathise Mal’s hardships (while not excusing her actions) and admit that the relationship wasn’t working anyways.</code></p>

<h2 id="five-things-i-liked-️">Five Things I Liked ❤️</h2>

<h3 id="1-evil-queen">1. Evil Queen</h3>

<p><strong>Evil Queen.</strong> An icon. A good quirky, not downright weird like Cruella. Little dialogue but she really made the most of it.</p>

<h3 id="2-evies-arc">2. Evie’s arc</h3>

<p><strong>Evie’s arc</strong> sends a really healthy message, too. Being the daughter of the Evil Queen who sought to be the prettiest, she starts off chasing after princes, vanity and her own looks, but ends up admiring simple Doug. And I’m glad that it wasn’t just a, “Oh, now you’re with Doug, you’ve found a partner and that solves all your self-esteem issues,” no—Mal affirms everything Evie already is, is already enough, so no need to keep chasing for more.</p>

<h3 id="3-love-potion">3. Love potion</h3>

<p>I thought, wouldn’t it be cool if <strong>the love potion didn’t work and Ben was faking it somehow</strong>? Then in the pre-climax, Ben reveals it wore off early on. I called it. This makes great story, because <strong>one</strong>: Ben is your standard, gentle, harmless paragon. The whole goody-two-shoes routine gets boring. But tbf (even better) it’s also broken up by his wild musical number at the 50% Midpoint. And <strong>two</strong>: in the climax, Ben has to be fully conscious to play his role as the paragon in truly believing in Mal when it matters the most. So, how to remove the love potion’s effects without him feeling betrayed by and losing faith in Mal? Reveal: the love potion wore off, and he’s been faking it.</p>

<p>This solution makes his character so more complex: he knows Mal’s nature to be malicious, yet plays along because he believes the good choice in her is stronger than her bad nature. Plus, he becomes more than just a naive king as even the main characters assume—<strong>he’s cunning, yet wise, and big-hearted</strong>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Though there could be more foreshadowing when the magic is supposedly washed away in the Enchanted Lake. Coming out of the water, he could have a confused expression, as he pieces it all together... but then considers how Mal just risked drowning to save his life, and we see the moment he plans and decides to play along, and act all lovey-dovey again.</code></p>

<h3 id="4-showing-character-arcs-not-telling">4. Showing character arcs, not telling</h3>

<p>On the night before the coronation, three of the gang have physical items representing the Truth that it’s possible for them to be happy while living contrary to their evil nature: the trophy; Dude the Dog; the B+ report. It’s always visually impactful to see <strong>physical manifestations of their character arcs</strong>. Mal gets nothing, though. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">So besides my addition of the sketch of Ben, she could also mull over that glowing wish ball that Ben gave her at the lake.</code></p>

<h3 id="5-janes-place-in-the-plot">5. Jane’s place in the plot</h3>

<p>It was interesting reveal that Jane (Fairy Godmother’s daughter) was the one who breaks the barrier with the Wand and sets off the climax. Having Mal suddenly double back on her character development and actually break the barrier would make things unnecessarily complicated, since she’s already on an upwards character arc after doing one or two double-backs. <strong>Jane also fulfills the example of the reverse argument</strong>: a child of a “good” parent making “evil”/selfish choices, proving again the Truth of this story that our nature is not our identity.</p>

<hr>

<p>So it turns out living overseas by yourself is tougher than it looks. It’s exactly two months today, in fact. I’ve had three entire posts written out because I knew I was gonna be busy, but WOW I’ve not had time to even think about writing.</p>

<p>It’s smack-middle of the semester now. Yea I also found out dissertations are no joke. So I’m going to be busy with that. Plus my social life, I’m barely attending one society, and barely getting time for friends back home, and barely networking out of the same old South East Asian people. It’s terrible lol</p>

<p>One good news. My flatmates and I have decided to order a 61-key MIDI keyboard to share. I’ve been wanting to properly pick it up for forever. Hopefully I can learn some more skills, and I’m purposely looking into the musical side of storytelling.</p>

<p>I’ll just post whenever there’s time but ugh it just takes so long to materialise thoughts into a document like this, and then package it into screenshots for Instagram. Hope to find friends here who can walk this road with me.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>So I’ll be giving my thoughts on this movie <strong>from a pure story perspective</strong>: excluding Mushu being voiced by a white guy + the low budget animation (well, besides the grieving scene in the rain; but everywhere else, sheesh) + historical/cultural (in)accuracies.</p>

<p>“It’s just a cheap direct-to-video cashgrab,” UGH profits. But from a story POV, why should we lower the bar for sequels? (Especially when Kung Fu Panda 2 exists).</p>

<p>Of course, we must compare it with the first movie. There weren’t really any iconic plot beats. Reflection. Cutting her hair, slipping away in the rain. Climbing the pole. The decimated village. Ugh, Mulan I is so good. Not perfect, but great and iconic.</p>

<p>I think while it set some good groundwork, and was a fun ride, a lot was still lacking narrative-wise, especially in the intellectual thematic argument, which has so much to say.</p>

<h2 id="plot-summary">Plot Summary</h2>

<p>(since y’all probably never watched it, some never will, here it is)</p>

<h3 id="prose">Prose</h3>

<p>Shang proposes to Mulan. Mushu would lose his status as family guardian, as well as Mulan, so decides to break them up. The Emperor summons the duo to escort his three princess daughters to form an alliance with Lord Qin to protect them from a coming Mongol invasion. They recruit the Gang of Three (Yao, Ling and Chien-Po) from the first movie.</p>

<p>En route, the three princesses fall in love with the Gang of Three. Mushu causes trouble for Mulan’s r’ship, accidentally destroying their carriage/supplies. The guards and princesses sneak out and enjoy a festival at a village, while Mushu orchestrates Mulan and Shang into a heated argument.</p>

<p>Shang puts his foot down, forbidding the three pairs to talk, then mutually breaks up with Mulan. They get attacked by bandits and Shang sacrifices himself for Mulan.</p>

<p>Mulan grieves, then offers herself as bride instead of the princesses. Shang returns to crash the marriage. Mushu masquerades as the Great Dragon to dissuade Lord Qin, and weds the duo on the spot.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-improve">What to improve</h2>

<h3 id="1-white-mushu">1. White Mushu</h3>

<p>Yea, discount Eddie Murphy was a hot mess. <strong>MulanII!Mushu was neither charismatic nor had his character explored enough</strong> to justify being conniving yet justify the audience’s sympathy, so he’s e just a bad bad guy. He’s just a plot device, it seems.</p>

<p>AND THEN when Mushu confesses what he’s done, and Mulan exclaims that Shang and her aren’t that different (this goes against <em>Lesson Number One</em>’s main message that differences are good). She then says all those problems weren’t because of themselves, but only because of Mushu (rip representation of a realistic couple working out their own flaws and differences, nope, if not for external forces, internally they are perfect, bro).</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Instead, we make</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mushu's arc a subplot about learning that there are circumstances where you must put duty over heart.</code></strong> WHAT?! Yes. One is not enough, we need both together. Mulan I was able to juggle advocating for the opposing themes of femininity vs masculinity.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What if</code> <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mushu learns that if Mulan gets married, he won’t just lose guardianship; she’ll physically never see him again.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">He must wrestle to make the honourable choice to put his duty as guardian to Mulan’s happiness over his heart to be with her. He could be tempted to meddle with the couple once or twice, but it only causes some small trouble that by itself shouldn’t start a spark; but the couple escalates it on their own. And later, when Mushu confesses, Mulan recognises it’s their own fault.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">We could also make a bigger deal of Mushu being the one to wed them, because he’s effectively done his duty but lost his friend. If you want a gut punch, Mushu is consequently invisible to Mulan forever. Mulan shows her gratitude for the best guardian ever.</code></p>

<h3 id="2-emperors-army">2. Emperor’s Army</h3>

<p><strong>The Emperor doesn’t want to send his daughters, so why not just let his army fight instead?</strong> He was so wise in the first one… and looks like the fool now. “trust me, bro”. Apparently Mongols are not from this era irl, so <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let’s simply say the last remnants of the Huns are overrunning towns.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Our kingdom’s males-of-age have been too diminished from Shan Yu’s campaign from the last movie, and the Emperor didn’t want the couple worrying after their great victory. But now he’s desperate, desperate enough to send his own daughters.</code></p>

<h3 id="3-mulans-theme">3. Mulan’s theme</h3>

<p><strong>Mulan also suddenly goes off about arranged marriages</strong> when Mulan was literally preparing to be match-made in the first 5 minutes of Mulan I. Even had a song about it. It’s also literally the culture. But she needs to oppose this tradition, because we need to explain it to the audience, and she has to mentor the princesses. The first song shows Mulan understands that you must balance both heart and duty — then why’s she so imbalanced towards heart?</p>

<p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mulan doesn’t need to be so polar opposite to duty.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The princesses can craft and imply their own ideas.

<p><strong>We don’t feel the pressure of the Mongols and the deadline.</strong> They literally get mentioned once vaguely at the start, and never hear of them again. We don’t have that decimated village suckerpunch from Mulan I. We don’t see the <a href="https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/what-are-pinch-points-and-how-can-they-make-your-book-easier-to-write/" class="web-link">consequences</a> if they fail their mission, if they choose heart over duty. “Duty” doesn’t get to make a single case for itself, so it gets brutally whalloped by <em>Heart/Emotions</em>. Past the Midpoint when Princess Ting-Ting swaps sides, Shang is singled out and antagonised for sticking to honouring one’s duty, when that going-above-one’s-duty is a virtue that is praised in Mulan I.</p>

<p>The antagonists should appear earlier. Instead, we could have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hun spies catch wind of the marriage alliance. They send assassins to attack the gang at pinch points just when things get too lovey-dovey: the guards are punished for following their heart.</code></p>

<p>This would also make up for <strong>the boring lack of action set-pieces</strong>. It’s so… political and interpersonal. Not that that’s bad, but how can you have a plot about delivering a royal escort, with only one coincidental attack by random bandits throughout the entire runtime?! We also don’t get to see Mulan’s iconic tactical ingenuity and thinking outside-of-the-box.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Let the Emperor send an entourage. Let the Huns attack, and they cause the carriage runaway sequence. The gang might, I don’t know, fly across a gorge, isolating them from the entourage for the rest of the journey. Next, Mulan and Shang could be arguing while doing some sparring practice, and someone gets accidentally hurt, physically and emotionally.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The surprise attack would be by a pack of elite soldiers, who know the legend Fa Mulan who downed Shan Yu and their entire army. We get moments of genius from Mulan, to the amazement of the princesses. Shang and Mulan awkwardly avoid each other because they just argued.</code></p>

<h3 id="5-clunky-dialogue">5. Clunky Dialogue</h3>

<p><strong>Clunky dialogue. It’s hit-or-miss.</strong> For every “It’s not about his heart, it’s about mine,” there’s twenty “I have another duty… to my heart!”</p>

<p>“In an ideal world, not everyone can marry for love! But the world isn’t perfect. I’m just glad my world is.” Wow Shang really just said “rip to them but we’re different” AGHH <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I don’t know, just say “Their case is different than ours; the entire kingdom depends on their marriage.”</code></p>

<p>While I liked that we got to see a couple resolving an everyday argument and saying sorry, I didn’t like how they’re suddenly both sexist?? “What is it with men and asking directions?” “What is it with women and maps?” At least make it sexist according to Chinese culture lol. And, if they apologise for that, that means they should affirm these toxic stereotypes.</p>

<pre><code class="language-screenplay-edited">SHANG
My father raised me as a soldier since I was a boy. You should trust my expert experience.

MULAN
The map is too ruined. You should consider your fiance’s advice.
</code></pre>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shang can even say something terrible, but cultural, like, “Did they even teach you anything in those rural schools?” but later regrets and acknowledges that’s out of line.</code></p>

<h3 id="6-anticlimactic-climax">6. Anticlimactic climax</h3>

<p><strong>The climax flopped.</strong> Mushu saves the day in a deus ex machina, the cardinal sin. Why did the princesses/guards even need to be there for, besides showing face? Mulan just kinda stood there. Shang throws a Japanese shuriken. Here’s a quick rewrite: (hah)</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Quick cuts of Shang, the princesses/guards and Hun assassins sneaking into the palace, knocking out the local guards, so there’s no one else to the rescue. When Shang crashes the wedding, the Huns spring into action, scattering everyone. Mulan and her handmaidens are backed up into a corner, hopelessly outnumbered, when they reveal to be the soldier trio in makeup disguise! Shang and the princesses disguised as soldiers protect the princes, who show their true colours as spoiled brats in front of the princesses.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">More fighting; Mushu wants to light a signal fire for help. He only puffs a small flame, then the soldier trio fan it so hard that it almost dies. The princesses step in and fan it gently, growing into a huge fire. Support arrives, rounding up the rest of the Huns. Emperor Qin honours the alliance without needing marriage.</code></p>

<h3 id="7-the-clown-prince">7. The Clown Prince</h3>

<p>Why is the foreign crown prince portrayed so dumb; I thought we decided with the soldier trio that we shouldn’t shame weird people. lol. Then the dad/Emperor just forgets about the whole alliance thing and plays with the chinese finger trap. bruh??? No thoughts, head empty.</p>

<h3 id="8-resolution">8. Resolution</h3>

<p><strong>There was no plot resolution.</strong> What happened to the alliance/the invasion?<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Since the Huns would’ve wiped all China, Mulan saved the Northern Kingdom too, but they did not reciprocate dutifully. Mulan could give some speech about dishonour, and the other Emperor would be ashamed, and agree to the alliance without the marriages.</code></p>

<p>What are the consequences of the princesses getting with lowly guards? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The guards could be sentenced to execution for treason (just like how in the first movie, Shang sentenced Mulan to death when he found out she was a woman), but the princesses step in gracefully, explaining their honour. They then offer to give up their royalty ties, and live as nobodies, but with their loves. yay</code></p>

<h2 id="what-i-liked">What I liked</h2>

<h3 id="1-princesses-as-main-characters">1. Princesses as main characters</h3>

<p>Giving <strong>the princesses</strong> some spotlight instead of Mulan. I like that it doesn’t try to force Mulan into a positive arc. Mulan <em>works</em> as a flat arc character, and it’s great to see her as a mentor to the princesses. We also see the flip side of the glamour of Disney princesses, and it ties well into Mulan’s themes: their responsibility to the kingdom. It’s not all glitter and princes: especially in Imperial China. It sets up a good conflict.</p>

<h3 id="2-songs">2. Songs</h3>

<p><strong>The two (2) songs bop.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Lesson Number One</em></strong> is Mulan teaching little girls that you can/should/must be strong AND gentle. It’s to the tune/style of honour to Us All with the training montage feel of Be A Man. All songs have lyrics about who “You must be…”, and it finally comes to a climax in this song. Would’ve been nice in the bridge, to see the girls trying to exaggerate being rough to imitate masculinity, but Mulan corrects them.</p>

<p><strong><em>Like Other Girls</em></strong> isn’t a song about them just wanting to run away with the guards; they want to escape the walls of their palace, a la Jasmine in Aladdin. It’s clear from the “It’s not about his heart, it’s about mine,” line that this goes deeper than just another romance song. (Yes, the “Like holding a lily” part is low-key racist, t’was a bad attempt at making a Western tone feel Chinese. Just keep it Western.)</p>

<h3 id="3-the-third-act-twist">3. The third act twist</h3>

<p>The third act twist: Mulan takes the princess’ place in arranged marriage. <strong>It is a stark reflection of how Mulan took her father’s place in the conscription, but in reverse</strong>, not going to war as a man, but to marriage as a woman. Again, Mulan makes the heroic, honourable choice of sacrificing her life, but in a subversive way.</p>

<p>“This is Fa Mulan, the hero who saved China! She is worth more than three princesses!” No matter how much Mulan excelled at being the stereotypical heroic male war hero, she was still treated just as a trophy wife.</p>

<p>Seems like just three points, but they are three very strong points.</p>

<hr>

<p>LOL so I watched a video where they talked about the cultural aspect of this movie. In the climax, Shang interrupts the wedding seal by throwing a <em>shuriken</em>. A Japanese shuriken. From a Chinese setting. hahahahahahahahha</p>

<h2 id="things-id-tweak-">Things I’d Tweak 🔧</h2>

<h3 id="1-elsas-arc">1. Elsa’s Arc</h3>

<p>Elsa has this inner conflict whether or not to answer this call but abandon her newfound family. After all, you can’t marry a man you just met. But she starts to say the throne is not where she belongs, fair enough. But then she starts drifting from Anna and from then on, she never had any doubts at all about going “alone and free”. All her conflict is just driven by Anna, but that doesn’t challenge her mind one bit.</p>

<p>So Elsa pushes Anna away and goes far away to an ice structure to discover who she really is, and pays the price for it. Sounds similar. Difference is, in F1, that’s the anti-lesson: that brings her further from her Need of “true love”. But in F2, Anna’s the antagonist for dissuading Elsa from achieving her destiny and if Elsa didn’t push her away and “go too deep”, then the curse would never be broken. It’s correct for Elsa to break her promise to stay together.</p>

<p><strong>Elsa’s arc is regressive and antithetical to the first movie</strong>. Female empowerment yay, but not at the cost at forgetting that the Frozen story has always been about the sisters coming “together”. Elsa longs for Anna more than anything in the world. That is the core of her character. Some things change, but must never contradict. Biggest gripe, because it’s so fundamental.</p>

<p>I’ve come up with an extremely simple tweak that completely recontextualises the entire story. <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">In Ahtohallan, instead of seeing their mom, Elsa could see memories of Anna.</code></strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Young Anna, teen Anna, adult Anna always there knocking at her door, Anna climbing up mountains for her, Anna giving up her life for her. Anna and Elsa are proof that magic and non-magic can coexist without fear but in true love. They succeed to love where King Runeard failed: they are Arendelle's second chance at redemption and reconciliation with Northuldria. Plus, since the Forest/Ahtohallan/whatever knows that Arendelle would be flooded if someone breaks the curse/dam, they bestowed Elsa with the power to hold the flood when the dam eventually must be broken.</code></p>

<h3 id="2-physical-antagonism">2. Physical Antagonism</h3>

<h4 id="2a-stakes-investment">2a. Stakes: Investment</h4>

<p><strong>Antagonism, or its force, is lacking in presence and in strength.</strong> Even though in F1, Hans was only revealed to be a villain towards the end, we still felt antagonistic force throughout the story with each rejection from Elsa, the world becoming winter and Anna’s frozen heart threatening to freeze her.</p>

<p>The elemental spirits presented an antagonistic force, but this movie is a case study of the weaknesses of forces of nature as antagonists. They felt too impersonal to the characters and too plot-heavy — attacks are coincidental, and they never develop throughout the story. The consequence of all this is that our protagonists don’t get challenged in the best ways possible.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, there <em>is</em> tension between the sisters (which is a little one-sided but ok), but the climactic fate of Arendelle could be handled better. For one, patriotism hasn’t been established to be a big thing, while personal stakes hit closer (as in F1). The audience doesn’t care if Arendelle lays in eternal winter or got flooded. The audience cares about individuals, that eternal winter means that Kristoff’s jobless, or that a frozen heart means Anna’s literally turning to ice, or that a flood means that the sisters will need to manage a kingdom without a land.</p>

<h4 id="2b-stakes-urgency">2b. Stakes: Urgency</h4>

<p>An antagonism shortcoming could be ascribed to a lack of urgency. I mean, Arendellians need a home, but how desperately? The dam needs to be broken, but why NOW? What’s the pressure? We call this the “or-else” factor: objective must be achieved before event or-else punishment.</p>

<p>A very simple fix is coined, “a ticking time-bomb”. In F1, the biggest example is Anna getting frozen in the heart: she must receive an act of true love before her hair goes all white <em>or else</em> she will freeze forever. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What if the "spirits" were dying due to the dam being built? Symbolically cause of injustice, and literally cause it holds back the water from the forest and restricting life. The curse must be lifted</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">before</code></em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">they grow too weak</code> <em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">or else</code></em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the the Forest becomes disenchanted (hah) and Elsa will be frozen (and Olaf will melt) cause she's a forest spirit. Just like that, there's so much pressure on both sides.</code></p>

<h4 id="2c-human-opposition">2c. Human Opposition</h4>

<p><strong>A physical villain/antagonist</strong> who embodied the idea of lies and selfish-nationalism would be great. He would be a great opposite-extreme villain to Hans, who represents danger when you open your doors too wide, versus someone who represents danger when you close your doors tight shut. Then came an amazing tweak that I read: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/12/02/the-5-biggest-problems-with-frozen-2/" class="web-link">a review article by Erik Kain</a> fantastically suggested, <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">what if King Runeard survived?</code></strong></p>

<p>![[frozen-ii-erik-kain-review.png]]</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Imagine: the Forest trapped King Runeard and his men, and he wants a way out. The Northuldrians know to break the dam to break the curse. He tells his soldiers, the dam would flood Arendelle regardless of the wall of mist, so they've been guarding it. 30 years later comes our gang who meets both parties. It goes mostly the same way except King Runeard whispers to the gang that all this history is proof that magic is more dangerous than good, and why we should keep the past locked up in the past, then convincing them to keep things the same.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Later, King Runeard may find out his son married a Northulda; Elsa being a spawn of the "evil" Forest and the mist, Runeard commands his soldiers to kill her to break the curse. Mattias, the king's guard, has his loyalty and character tested. Runeard doesn't have to be another plot-twist villain; he could be obviously manipulative but spits real facts that, hey, Anna, you actually DIED last movie because of Elsa — are you really okay with that?</code></p>

<h3 id="3-kristoff">3. Kristoff</h3>

<p>Objectively, <strong>Kristoff’s subplot weighed the story down.</strong> I get where they were going that Kristoff’s love for Anna “is not that fragile”, and that his love never changes. But if you can cut a subplot, you cut it. It doesn’t really contribute. There was a lot of distracting and uncharacteristic dialogue and conflict for the sake of conflict between Anna and Kristoff. The proposal felt VERY out of place in the climax; it could be saved after her coronation.</p>

<p>But there’s other ways Kristoff can contribute; he’s such, such a complex character. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">He fits better with the Arendelle soldiers who are skeptical about magic, just as he was once skeptical about love. You could also meld Ryder with Mattias into one character: make them/him very stoic and distant at first, being the king's guard, like Kristoff initially was in F1. But Mattias loves reindeer too, and Kristoff can use that bond between man and reindeer to show Mattias his love for Anna, and by extension, the love Arendelle should have for Northuldria.</code></p>

<h3 id="4-deaths">4. Deaths</h3>

<p><strong>The deaths could have been set-up better.</strong> Olaf’s was okay, because from the very first movie it was a forefront problem that he melts under heat, and the false safety in the start of the second that Olaf now had permafrost. In fact, Olaf’s death gave good weight to Anna’s character. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Only suggestion is to show in the beginning when Elsa awakens the spirits, she could lose her powers for a moment — and Olaf could start to fade — but he recovers as her powers come back. Then there's the ever-looming threat and the setup where the audience knows, if Elsa dies then Olaf dies. That way, when Olaf's time comes, it's not as sudden.</code> But that’s no big deal.</p>

<p>What bothered me more was how Elsa’s death was (not) foreshadowed. You’ve got the “not too far or you’ll be drowned”, and a reminder again with Honeymaron about warnings. For others it’s okay, but in my first viewing, I didn’t get that complete emotional payoff. <em>Set-ups to deaths are like prophecies of doom.</em> First, all that can’t be the only foreshadowing for a major death. Second, if anything, it led me to believe she would drown in water.</p>

<p>I have to compare Elsa’s death with Anna’s death in the first movie: we knew Anna was always in danger of getting frozen™, and we’ve seen it nearly happened at the start of the movie when they were children. All throughout Frozen 1, we hear the trolls explain (to us) very specifically, twice. At least both deaths were fitting for their character arcs. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What if, for Elsa's death in Frozen II, the deeper Elsa went into Ahtohallan, the more she loses her magic (shown by how she can't make ice constructs anymore), and the more she paradoxically feels cold. If anything, it makes her sacrifice to find the truth even heavier because she gets to deliberate for a long time that she must pay the price for it.</code></p>

<h3 id="5-avatar-elsa">5. Avatar Elsa</h3>

<p>Nitpicking: <strong>the whole Avatar-Elsa-master-of-all-four-elements is not really touched on and is distracting at best</strong>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Just keep it simpla la and have only one water spirit because it relates to Elsa's ice and the whole water-is-memory and we see Elsa memory/water-bending and it makes sense. The other spirits can just be just normal Forest creatures who are angy. We still see the plot reveal of Elsa's-power-is-from-the-forest from a mile away — we don't need a hint that requires a whole I'm-the-fifth-element and other things to be part of the lore. We could still fit in a post credits where some girl in some other kingdom wakes up bending fire or smthn.</code></p>

<h2 id="things-i-liked-️">Things I Liked ❤️</h2>

<h3 id="1-matured-character-development">1. Matured Character Development</h3>

<p>One moment that hit me was near the start after Elsa walked out of charades and into her room; Anna knocked on her door and Elsa said “Come in,” which says a LOT, in the context of the first movie.</p>

<p>Our ever-optimistic Anna was broken down all the way to barebones and she’s tested for who she really is, and Olaf became “sadder and wiser”, finally going through what all snowmen have to.</p>

<p>They’ve learnt in the first movie how you can’t simply throw your heart around to anyone; they’ve learnt that love is free but comes at the greatest cost. Now they have to learn what happens when seasons change and all is lost.</p>

<h3 id="2-mature-and-dark">2. Mature and Dark</h3>

<p>I mean, don’t have grim for the sake of grim; but for a sequel whose predecessor was aimed at a young audience, they were willing to express mainly about loss and change and grief. Death of childhood figure (reminiscent of Bing Bong’s death from Inside Out) hit hard, that one. Olaf’s death was real, and meaningful. We jump from Anna cradling Olaf, to a wide shot of the forest, and then back to the cave, Anna’s arms now empty. That was good.</p>

<p>Then there’s war crimes and national secrets. on the one hand it feels a little too big-scale, but they do run a kingdom now.</p>

<h3 id="3-very-different-theme">3. Very Different Theme</h3>

<p>I was really confused at first at how <strong>different the themes</strong> of Frozen 1 line up with that of Frozen 2. I had many expectations and theories for sure, based off what has been established, like something about the <strong>theme of love vs. fear in family</strong>. Sequels need to develop the themes of the prior movie, with varying success across Kung Fu Panda, Toy Story, Wreck-it-Ralph, HTTYD, all the direct-to-video Disney films etc. Some stories just rehash the old theme with the same characyters going through the same character arcs. Other stories go off the opposite extreme deep end, cancelling out whatever they tried to say from the first movie.</p>

<p>But coming in, the first two songs set the tone and <strong>theme of change and truth in love</strong>. I had to drop everything I thought I knew (heh, which is what one of the movie’s messages) and just let myself enjoy the movie. Which was good, otherwise I would’ve been too intellectual all the way through.</p>

<p>And now in hindsight… the themes do relate strongly to the original, a development of he original, even — while still standing very apart on their own. I could never have predicted how it would develop. It’s not clear at first, but it’s a very tight, waterproof choice of theme.</p>

<h3 id="4-visuals">4. Visuals</h3>

<p>Interesting camera action/perspectives. The colours were really bold and vibrant. Orange landscape to contrast deep blue water and bright blue ice. Purple to represent fire, and also royalty. Costuming was a really nice change from the first movie too, which helped me to acclimatise to the new themes. There was this post on the significance of characters’ costuming, which was purposeful.</p>

<h3 id="5-musical-motifs">5. Musical motifs</h3>

<p>There were <strong>familiar musical and thematic motifs from the first movie</strong>, even if I wished they were more frequent and apparent. In just Some Things Never Change alone, you could hear parts of First Time in Forever (both songs mirror each other). The intro of Into The Unknown seems like a reordered and minor key-ed intro of Do You Want To Build A Snowman. Olaf melting, being frozen, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hThEIOeMTgM" class="web-link">Vuelie (From “Frozen”/Score)</a>. But this <strong>level of familiarity is probably a good thing was probably a conscious choice to not milk the nostalgia</strong> of the former hit as sequels are prone to do. They were similar but not repetitive. There was lots of new ground.</p>

<h3 id="6-self-awareness">6. Self-awareness</h3>

<p>Okay Olaf and his recaps and Samantha was pretty funny tbh. Other than Kristoff’s interactions with Anna, <strong>the movie’s comedy is great</strong>. A lot of self-referencing, which I enjoyed as a whole.</p>

<p>Another Disney live-action but a twist on the original story (and wow is this so different). I appreciate how they try to reinnovate the source material and dare to take a “mature” tone. Visuals were Disney-class stunning for sure. Certain moments certainly gripped my heart, and the characters presented are very complex.</p>

<p>A million dreams for the posts we’re gonna make. It was different to type this one out because it being a montage, there were so many visual elements to get hold of. You really learn a lot about the character (pasts, beliefs, goals) and journey through their childhood in just the span of a song. Nothing will ever measure to Up’s Married Life, but this one I really like the strong moments of action and dialogue in between.</p>
